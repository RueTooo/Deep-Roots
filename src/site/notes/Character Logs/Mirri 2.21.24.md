Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.
*Day 5 in the Feywilds*

We found ourselves a cave to rest in and introduced ourselves properly to the Tabaxi we picked up yesterday; [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck-of-the-Draw]], also known by an alias of [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jerinn]]. A man (cat?) after my own heart—I wasn’t pleased to lose my bag of Blink Dog teeth and claws, but I am more than happy to help a like-minded entrepreneur make some quick gold!

Unfortunately, the giddiness of finding a friend keen on making mischief with me was short-lived. I was right… the [[Ambassador Ushan\|Ambassador Ushan]] [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]] spoke of was indeed the same one I know. At best, the Tabaxi has been trapped here in the Feywild for a century. At worst…. I’d say the kindest estimate would be about 300 years, going off of the dogwood story.

[[Lord Lysenthir\|Lord Lysenthir]] is the Spring Emissary now, at any rate. So whatever insult [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]] gave once, it is likely forgotten. Not that it will make up for the rest of it…

I took the last watch with [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]], thinking hard on how long we have been here ourselves. My journal says five days, but is that even right? How much time has passed in [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari]]? Will I return a hundred years later than when I left, having not aged a day?
      
I did take a moment to inform [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] of my intentions with some of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow]]’s newest gifts… and I was reminded again that I’m, well, **me.** I hope the creature that has made a mission of getting me into trouble at least admires my audacity.

At the very least, it’ll make a good story.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] was attacked. The godsdamned dwarf came back through the mage’s pack and ***attacked my friend.*** The little fucker was dead in under a minute. Good riddance.

I know I snapped at [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] and I shouldn’t have. I should have been kinder, I should have made sure they were okay first, asked questions later, but I just… I couldn’t stop myself. I saw the blood and my mind… I know where it went. That’s not the point. I should know better by now.

We went through the bag. There were measures in place to prevent intruders, something we should have thought of, but didn’t, and the bars of the cage were the same as the metal from those manacles. The ones that I could not break off. I know that they vanished after… **after** and I never did figure out where they went. Only the cost of their removal.

Aerendyl said they were made of **cold iron**. I don’t care what it’s called, I want to be as far away from it as possible. The very touch of it brings back memories that I don’t want to endure more than I already do.

First [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]], bleeding and hurt. Then the iron. I shouldn’t have snapped at her but all I could think of was…

Stop getting attached, Mirri, you thrice-damned, hypocritical fool. You know how it will end. They are your friends as long as you are useful to them. ***So be useful.***

[[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] freed us by adding us to a ledger for these Bloody Poachers. Their base, if that is what this place is, is open to us and what little I’ve found so far only confirms the half-orc’s words—these are “bad people.”

I know she doesn’t like me and probably never will, but [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] at least felt comfortable dumping some magical equipment onto me. I can do that. I can be useful. I can be a mage if that is what they need. Be useful.

Find out who’s singing. That’s useful.
