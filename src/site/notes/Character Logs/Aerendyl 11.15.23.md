*[Session 6] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

This cavern is a maze of things to explore, truly. By some stroke of luck, I was pulled into one direction over another. Though, I will leave this note to myself: must return to the water later to take a dive and see what the light in the water is about. It might just be a shrine to [[Nexus\|Nexus]] … Details will follow once I've actually verified.

In the past few hours, I've gone a different route. Along with [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]], [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] and a priest called [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Xandri Khalkos\|Xandri]], I stepped into the small, rectangular building after its interior somehow was unlocked while I hemmed and hawed over that light in the water.

It wasn't just any room, though. Upon entering, I was cast into a dream I had as a child, before [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|the Stonecutter]] left. It was rather a bizarre dream, but one that shook me to my core and left me weeping in my bed at the time. I dreamt of [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|the Stonecutter]]'s death – or, rather, finding out about it. My juvenile self found him in a bed outside, having passed all alone, nursing the same stone I have embedded in my chest. Perhaps it was a warning of some sort – of whom I would lose and just how fast, at that.

I awoke from that moment that couldn't truly have lasted more than a few seconds, but it felt like a lifetime spent in that liminal space between the past and the present; conscious and subconscious. As I opened my eyes, I found we were all not in that small building we entered; not really. It turned out we found the shoreline of the [[Astral Sea\|Astral Sea]], for lack of a better word.

Convictions and willpower rule supreme here. Priestess [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Xandri Khalkos\|Xandri]] displayed as much by floating off of the cliff we wound up on. She suggested that dream and my new understanding of it might have been [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Aesa\|Aesa]] (Weaver of Dreams) reaching out, in a sense — and most importantly, that I should likely decide on whether to chase more dreams and therefore insight before I sleep next.

I had more questions I would've asked (what would opening myself up as such entail, for instance?), if not for the thunderous noise that summoned us back to the main cavern. Another note to myself, then: Find [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Xandri Khalkos\|Xandri]] later …

Upon return to our realm, we found [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] had managed to open the gate another passage or area. With our ragtag group reunited, we all set out to explore this new discovery, and land ourselves in a chamber fringed with enormous amethysts, their cores pulsing with various colours. I almost felt like home …

We came upon a large, hexagonal structure at the centre, surrounded by several piles of stone. After some trial and error (involving testing the order and orientation of the stone slabs, and reading characters suspended in the amethysts themselves), we managed to unlock a tune of some sort.

Upon mimicking it, the doors leading into the hexagon opened, and we were immediately greeted by a corpse. Lovely! Gods, moments like these make me miss life back in [[Tornwing Haven\|Tornwing Haven]] … but I digress.

This is where things got interesting. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] recognised the corpse – or their attire, I suppose? Either way: I, too, recognised the mask belonging to the corpse. I spoke to them of my adventure with Bell years ago, back along the peaks of the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]] mountain range; about how we sought shelter from a storm in a cavern, found a pair of bumbling cultists attempting a summoning of some sorts, and even the detail about the ten foot door [[Bell\|Bell]] dropped on them.

I revealed one of the masks I found on the corpses, briefly touched upon the tattoo on one of the cultists’ neck (that sun with the empty core), and the draconic script found along the door in the cavern wall, and what I recall of it from the [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall]] temple dedicated to one of the first dragons.

( Now that I've looked back on my old entries, I also recall [[Bell\|Bell]] said he was from an area close to a ‘cursed forest’ … Could that be the forest that was sealed off to contain the [[Terms and phrases/Pale Blight\|Pale Blight]]? The ‘root’ of that infection on this plane, that the crystal dragon tried to protect it from? A child of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Tiamat\|Tiamat]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Bahamat\|Bahamat]]?… A thought for later rumination, I suppose. )

Back to the hexagonal building, in which I'm scribbling away now: we found more corpses, and a chamber ravaged by violence and fire, it seems. The room has three massive murals, featuring a whole variety of scripts – [[Languages/Celestial\|Celestial]], [[Languages/Sylvan\|Sylvan]], [[Languages/Primordial\|Primordial]], [[Languages/Elvish\|Elvish]], [[Languages/Dwarvish\|Dwarvish]], [[Languages/Draconic\|Draconic]] – outlining some dense, arcane instructions.

[[Languages/Primordial\|Primordial]] and [[Languages/Elvish\|Elvish]] I can help with, but the rest … time to figure out what we ( read: [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] ) can make of it!
