*Personal Diary, Entry 44, 20th of Bloomwave, year 515*

I have journeyed to the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Arkehost Oasis/Arkehost Oasis\|Arkehost Oasis]] on the request of a colleague of mine, I didn't stay long in town to do much but find a cheap inn and pay for a room tonight and tomorrow. With some foresight I probably could've saved a few silver but what's done is done. My colleague as well as the info I could personally gather has me understand that the dragon, "The Old One," that I saw fly off with portions of the Halls of Ancestry has landed in the desert and dug itself underground. So many of my field are here to research and document the event, and in another time I'd be here for the exact same reason. Instead I've made this trek in the pursuit of knowledge of ancient artifacts.

Initially I hoped to find and speak with as many scholars here as I could, so many in the same place after all! However things changed once I had actually entered the desert. I passed many ancient structures, most buried in the sand, few with attempts at restoration abandoned long ago, until I came across rock walls with faded murals of a dragon-kind story of creation. I will not recount the story here as I go in depth on these things within books of mine as well as my research notes. Most interesting is that I had stumbled upon a well, almost entirely covered but with just enough room for Sid to squeeze in and explore.

A very long way down, but at the bottom a "room" or more of an expansion of the well that had walls of petrified wood. A space in the center held what appeared to be a blank sheet of parchment, and a doorway with no handle or keyhole. Now extremely curious about what is down there I have begun setting camp outside of the well. I intend to use some of my newfound* magic to enter my ring and allow [[Animal Companions/Obsidian\|Sid]] to carry me down to that space. I will be stuck down there for the night however so I shall leave behind letters in my camp for passerby's. I have several theories but theres only one way to test them. Wish me luck.

*Can I truly call it newfound after this much time? I don't use the magic much outside of [[Animal Companions/Obsidian\|Sid]] but it still has been several months.
