*Session 1 log: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age.*

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I arrived at [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Arkehost Oasis/Arkehost Oasis\|Arkehost Oasis]] at what must have been the hottest part of the day, close to the ruins the sightings and rumours along the way have been pointing us towards. It was the first actual settlement I'd seen in days – that is, a settlement with solid buildings, rather than yurts and tents belonging to nomads.

Given the relentlessness of the sun beating down us the past couple of days, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I made way for a tavern (Serenity's Rest) to rest up, first of all. As luck would have it, we wound up stumbling head first into gossip about precisely our topic of interest: the nearby ruins. Other people have already beaten us to them. There is now a massive digsite, apparently, with interested parties having themselves lowered into the ground to discover whatever relics they might find there.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I had our meals and drinks first, and with by some good fortune and a few ales, we managed to strike up a useful (and pleasant!) conversation with some other patrons. They told us of the history of this oasis; of how it used to span many more miles across, until a magic cataclysm of sorts sent fire raining from the skies, and set the town aflame. Only this small part of the former grand town is now inhabited. People here do not view magic favourably as a result, and avoid the remnants of the burnt down parts of the settlement almost as a form of superstition.

Good, now that we have that bit of interesting context out of the way, and I know to keep my casting to a minimum: the dragon we've been chasing, crash-landed just outside the village. I didn't realise we were *that* close, but a bit of good news is always welcome.

[[Imarin\|Imarin]], a Tabaxi blacksmith, mentioned his sister, [[Aziza\|Aziza]], went there with a crew and to manage all the comings and goings of those who are lowered into the hole. Perhaps we can find her and gather some more information once we're there ... He spoke about sandstorms, too – we need to ask the [[Duskwardens\|Duskwardens]] about those for any details, so that's what [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I set out to do once our tankards had run dry.

We meet someone named [[Jalis\|Jalis]] by the entrance. Inside of the tower, we saw massive sheets of canvas, depicting basic maps of the settlement. Differently coloured ribbons and strings, red here, blue there, depict weather patterns across them. They're not too dissimilar from diagrams my circle used to predict the weather.

Having taken in these maps, I'll have a better understanding of what to expect when we're out in the desert once more. I also see a storm is approaching, set to reach these parts some hours after tomorrow's dawn. By early afternoon, we'll be unable to move through it without risking our lives, and these circumstances will not wane for another two to four days. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I had best set out overnight.

[[Jalis\|Jalis]] told us at least fifty people have already passed through the settlement to visit the ruins. She also tells us about what we might expect when we make our way there, too – such as strange moving lightning; balls that descend from the sky remain in place until someone comes close enough for them to strike. Sometimes, they descend into the sands only to never be seen again, resulting in the surrounding sands becoming electrified. If encountered, we should cast some type of counterspell upon sight or prepare ourselves to be exposed to their charge.

We’ll also find mephits, and, if we're not careful, ravenous sands …

[[Jalis\|Jalis]] eventually suggested one of the [[Duskwardens\|Duskwardens]] join us as a guide:

- Nahiri Swiftpaws, one of the Tabaxi locals.
- [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk the Mighty]], a lizardfolk person.

They can be found in the temple or serenity’s rest. We'd best pay them a visit, make our choice, potentially buy some additional supplies, and set out as soon as we can.
