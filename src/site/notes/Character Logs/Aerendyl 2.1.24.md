*Session 16 Day 24? of Bloomweave, year 515 T.A.?*
We wrapped things up in the gruesome aftermath of our scuffle with the poachers, with [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] securing the magical pack the dwarven woman used to escape. Exiting the room, we then marched toward the dagger [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] is tracking. A split-second action unfolded in the main chamber: someone released a bolt from a crossbow towards [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]], narrowly missing her. The result? Another chaotic bout with poachers singling out [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]].

During all of that, it took but one spell for the very ground beneath me to soften, leaving a trail of lichen, moss, and fungus marking where I stood ( and stand, still ) — wild magic. The flora spreads the longer I linger in place. I suppose it is better than to be turned green or have my hair transformed into ivy, but I might change my mind about it if it turns out I'll need to hide from something sometime soon. This leaves little to the imagination as to my whereabouts ...

But I digress. The skirmish revealed the poachers' vulnerability to silver, much like fiends. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] struck down the last one wielding a pair of unique daggers, one adamantine and the other enigmatic in its magic. I suppose one of those was the one she was tracking.

With [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]]'s aid, I frisked the fallen, revealing crossbow bolts, a shortbow, a hand crossbow, and a curious pendant – gold coin pierced through its center, with a worn [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]] stamp on one side. Looting eventually netted us four platinum coins each, 2 of which I've since relinquished to [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]. Speaking of [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]: he, meanwhile, drew us into the cavern's main space, away from the heat of the lava, pointing out a plethora of flying beings, invisible save for his enchanted sight. He sketched their likenesses, the images doing little to ease my discomfort — pixies or nixies likely under hellish influence.

Our ensuing rest in the poachers' abandoned camp turned out pensive. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] circled back to his musings on [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]], which I conceded to the background of my perception as I sought solace in meditation. What catches my ear, though, are warnings: avoid pledging our souls, steer clear of dying on sigils, and don't imbibe blood from altars — lest we forget: souls are the currency of devils.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] reached a palpable breaking point that took me out of my effort to centre myself, rebuking [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] for entertaining infernal bargains. With fervour, they proclaimed the weight of souls and the gravity of making pacts with devils, not long after which they stormed away in exasperation, leaving the group ( and by[[ Lady Sunnis\| Lady Sunnis]], I hope that includes [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] ) to truly __consider__ the potential ( or likely ) ramifications for oneself and the greater world.

A warlock-centred discussion then unfolded between [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]], as it so often does, its intricacies eluding me as I descended back into meditation.

Alas, the brief respite shatters as [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]'s panic cuts through. His alarm crescendoed with [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]'s shouting, a harbinger of imminent chaos spilling from the main chamber. Off to greet another potential demise we go.

Assuming we survive this, I hereby leave this note to my future self: check in with [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]], now that their hunt is ostensibly concluded.
