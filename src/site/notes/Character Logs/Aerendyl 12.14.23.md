*Session 9 Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

As [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Nightbloom]], [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and I caught up to the others, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]'s dire warning continued echoing through the stairwell – we were all to be careful not to fall in battle, lest our corpses be dragged down to feed the sigil below.

Emerging upstairs, we found ourselves in the chamber full of amethyst and those … ‘singing stones’ again, the space now fully illuminated. Two wounded were steadily being dragged towards the stairs by two more invisible demons as a new horror unfolded.

[[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Nightbloom]] stood steadfast beside me, unsheathing her adamantine shortsword, which glinted that menacing, yet mesmerising shade of adamantine green. I understood we were to stand guard here, blocking any further descent.

Once acid started seeping from the nearest fiend’s still invisible body after receiving its first wounds, it was somewhat easy to pinpoint its location. Enough so, at least, to allow an approximate aiming of [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Thunderwave\|Thunderwave]]. As before, this ( fortunately ) revealed its nightmarish form to all of us. [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Nightbloom]] then pinned the creature in place for all of us to chip away at it ( at no small personal expense on her end, judging by the look of it ), before she finished it off. This time, I managed to protect my eyes just in time to prevent any blindness from its acid spray.

Moments later, another crack of thunder exposed the second demon as it approached, amidst the frenzy of violence unfolding among us all. Perhaps these beasts in general are vulnerable to thunder …

It seemed unperturbed, continuing to drag its intended sacrifice towards [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Nightbloom]] and myself, until one of the unfamiliar faces swiftly ended its advance with a strike of a hammer — compressing its head with enough force to send its corrosive acid into my eyes before I had the chance to shield them again.

Somewhere between trying to blink the gunk away, the fresh memory of the figure behind the hammer bearing down on our foe came to me. I recalled them blessing some of our allies earlier — perhaps they can help us attain the holy water we require to perform the cleansing downstairs?
