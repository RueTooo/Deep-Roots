Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.
*Day 4 in the Feywilds*

[[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] has left us.

It sounds much too kind when I write it like that, but the truth of the matter is this: he chose. He chose his own survival. I will not hold that against him. No, it is the path he chose that I take issue with. Three souls in exchange for his own, three lives forever altered, ended maybe, to save his own skin. I have done some nasty things to keep myself alive and I’ve no qualms with killing… but I could not do that. I could not force another to endure what I have, save the man who put me here.
I will remember the bright-eyed academic who had the habit of reading everything aloud. I will remember the young man I knew so briefly. I will mourn that I could not save him.
But I will remember him. I will remember him, the name of his Patron, and the new pact he forged. I hope he will never have to face someone like me, young and broken and filled with hatred for a man they did not know, who destroyed their life in a single act of selfishness.

I only wish that I had not said so much. To have these people who have known me only a matter of days know what no one else ever has?

Worst of all was [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] telling me of a green-eyed shadow that watches over me. I know who it was she saw. I wish she had said nothing. I wish she had let me have but one moment where I did not have to remember it. One more moment between sleeping and waking where he was safe and I had not failed. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] did not intend to tear the wound open, but it bleeds again all the same.

He would be about [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]]’ age, now.

All this melancholy has distracted me from a gift that nearly drove me to tears—genuine ones, not the false tears that fall after my dreams. [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow]] has gifted me new marks on the palms of my hands. My hands, the focus of my anxiety and shame. My hands, that I have spent so many years avoiding, clenching in fists at my sides so that I would not put them near my mouth. And she has chosen them to hold the symbols of her love, her pride.

Oh, [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]], you frightened fool. I want no one bound by Pact to know anything other than this. Even a fraction of this unwavering loyalty, of the love I have never been able to hold onto in the waking world.

It doesn’t matter now. We are in the [[Krumholtz Mountains\|Krumholtz Mountains]], heading to the Autumn Court. To **him.**

I nearly forgot where we are. Of course we would encounter pixies & I remembered almost too late that we had been warned! We encountered a Tabaxi just before we realized we were under obligation to provide entertainment…

*I panicked.* All the stories I had told [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]] while he was growing up vanished from my head and I was left scrambling. The only story of sufficient tragedy was my own. I told them of my mother… and of my father. I edited the ending of course, for fear that my friends would latch onto it, for fear that I would lay myself bare before them again.

Our new friend, the Tabaxi, is called **[[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]]**, I believe they said. They seem a little… off and said that an **[[Ambassador Ushan\|Ambassador Ushan]]** exiled them to the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] for some insult or another.

It… It can’t be the same [[Ambassador Ushan\|Ushan]] I know of… that would mean…
