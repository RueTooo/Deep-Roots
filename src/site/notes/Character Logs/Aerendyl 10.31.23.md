*Session 4: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

What a day, indeed. We were granted access to yet another room after offering the dragon statue a piece of silver. This new room, too, held a statue – albeit a rather eroded one – with another riddle:

> Test of Trust, Strong Hands Muster. Path Laid Plain, Harm Brings Pain

There was also a chalk design on the floor, vaguely reminiscent of one of [[Tornwing Haven\|Tornwing Haven]]'s meditative walking paths my peers from the [[Circle of Seven\|Circle of Seven]] would traverse when posed with a particularly stubborn disease, cure or other ailment. The challenge in the adjacent space, however, had nothing to do with healing.

It felt like a dark pocket realm of some sort. There was an oval-shaped ring made of what seemed to be obsidian, decorated with more designs in all sorts of colours with orbs at their centres, and broken train tracks across the gap in the middle of the ring. Thaddeus took lead, and after his initial examination, we all joined up, gathering the orbs along the way and slotting them into this statue's staff – to no immediate effect, but … what else could be the purpose of such a perfect fit?

On the statue's headband, we read: 
> walk beside me, you who brave the path. 

It was as clear an indicator we were meant to push the statue across the tracks, including the gap about halfway through, and so we did, all four of us.

Along the way, three motes of lightning materialised out of nowhere — I think they were playing with us, in a way. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] managed to shepherd most of them away at length, and apart from getting exposed to a few zaps, we reached the terminal of the tracks safely, upon which the statue, the orbs and the lightning all simply vanished.

Lo and behold: the statue in the first room appeared as new upon our return! Now, it's time we rest – we've been on our feet for too long already.

*Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

Our day started with yet another flight of stairs that needed traversing, followed by one more chamber with a statue. This one, a figure folded into themself with wings wrapped about them, revealed no riddle; it only evoked a keen sense of melancholy. I got the impression this would have to do with the trial ahead, and so we all set out into the adjacent space.

It took us outside, in a sense, into a husk of a campsite. The fireplace was dishevelled, broken items lay strewn about, and the tent was hardly worthy of its name. Inside it, we found an ailing person — hypothermic. Given that everything around her, including her bedroll, was wet, that was no surprise.

Foolishly, I did not think to offer the amulet [[Vigil\|Vigil]] gave me. It's kept me warm on so many cold nights, I might as well have fused with it at this point. Bygones and all that …

To keep a long story short: we fixed things around camp, decorated a makeshift grave or tribute to a deceased loved one, and provided the sleeping person with renewed shelter, food and warmth.

(Though, I will admit to finding the contents of that grave – of sorts – will stick with me. The string about the pouch of contents I found in it was capped off with a hexagonal coin that read ‘Remember all things live. Remember all things die.’)

Upon sensing we had helped the person in question, we moved back into the other chamber. The statue had changed – it almost seemed a different statue entirely: open, content, and bearing gifts! _I_ was given a cleansing stone. (I love stones!)

With our new items, we return to the room that started this particular branch of the journey – the one with the statues and the fountain. Its door had finally opened to us, and the room it revealed was ( and is ) nothing short of astonishing. A massive tree stands at its centre, its branches seemingly iron with silvery leaves. There’s all manner of items around the periphery of the room, too – a massive crystal, a compass, so many scrolls, books, and more than I can describe. Time to find out!
