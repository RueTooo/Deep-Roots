*Session 2 log: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I contracted [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]] to take us to the ruins in the desert. Before we even set out, though, a great beam of golden light came down into the desert (or was it going *up* from the desert?). The locals told us it apparently meant someone was in the ruins of the south side of the old city — more specifically in the 'testing tower’, attempt to … well, take its tests. I still wonder if this somehow relates to the lit towers of [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]] …

Either way, we set out as intended on our 3 - 4 hour hike once [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]] was ready to go, intent on reaching our destination before the morning's sandstorm would roll in. But we got curious about the light, of course, so we asked [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]] to take a detour with us towards that light. He told us that there where the light touched down, the temple of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Hystaa\|Hystaa]], goddess of Justice, lies. Apparently, the light served as a ‘bell gong’ for [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Hystaa\|Hystaa]]'s clerics and other devotees. The tower is meant to judge whether the temple's visitors are worthy of entrance into its archives.

Just as we approached the tower, we crossed paths with another traveller — a dragonborn of some noble standing. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]], she introduced herself as. She wound up joining us for the final stretch, and I must admit, I was rather content for it.

Before long we came across a tent pitched next to a barely opened well. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] spotted a letter there, written by a [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus Quill]], requesting a rescue if he wasn't back by tomorrow (the 21st).

[[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] managed to carve away some of the heavy, solid stone lid on the well, and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] – with troublingly little forethought – decided to try climbing down the hole. We couldn't even see where it ended! What we also couldn't see was its taper. She could've plummeted to her death then and there!

Fortunately, she made it back out alive, after which I forced my climbing kit on her. Our minds had somehow gotten made up about one thing in the meantime: we did want to make our way down there. Especially [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] seemed intent on doing this, as she'd recognised the name on the letter.

After gracelessly shouting down the well, a small, red … dragon? shot up from the well and whizzed right past us, and what do you know? Mr Quill spoke to us through the little rascal! He tells us the way down is about 200 feet, so for those with no climbing kit, we decide to tie together all our ropes and [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]] makes a ladder of it.

He made an awful noise anchoring it to the stone, but given the lack of other options, I can't rightfully blame him. Either way, we all made our way down at length in various ways. [[Spiderwalk\|Spiderwalk]] made it a smooth trek on my end, and fortunately permitted me to catch our dutiful guide mid-plummet down the hole. His hand must've cramped, or something …

We landed in a room with coloured, lit up circles on the ground and strange, red flowers around the edges. A single sheet of blank paper was left on a pedestal in the centre of the room. Upon investigation we realised we needed to sign our names on the paper – or otherwise identify ourselves, as one would in a guest book. A licked thumb was apparently enough, likewise [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]]’ signet ring pressed into the paper with some blood of hers. This opened a door into a hallway, but not before another large beam of light shot up. That answered my question as to the precise origin of the light, at least.

Going through the door felt like passing through the portal in [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall]] … As I looked back to see if it was indeed a portal, a fresh, unblemished piece of paper sat on the pedestal. *Interesting*.

The next room had a table with all sorts of papers and scrolls on it. On the floor we also found a geometric pattern drawn with yellow paint. Not even a bird's eye view could help me recognise what it was meant to signify, unfortunately.

This left me with nothing to focus on but the table and everything strewn across it. All the scattered sheets reminded me of ~~my father's~~ the Stonecutter's journal. Different parchments textures, ages, styles of writing … a collection of oddities. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I realised these were all personal accounts, knowledge, recipes, notations on maps, poems with annotations, et cetera.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] revealed we were meant to contribute to the collection with something personal of sorts. I drew [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall]], adding notes here and there, and signed my initial below it.

Some 30 feet above, massive images suddenly appeared on the walls. A view of Sandfall from [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Lady Sunnis\|Lady Sunnis]]’ tower appears. It revealed metallic gleams and glints, showing the veins of metals and veins from city. On another wall, the [[Stratera university\|Stratera university]] which father helped build, with the Lapis Lazuli dome on display, encrusted with diamonds — just as magnificent as I remembered! Another wall depicts some of the more dangerous paths, with homes built into the cliff-walls that constantly fluctuate and shift under the element's force. I realise these are other people’s perspectives on my home …

The others see my entry only after they add their own to the pile, and vice versa.

In [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]]’ ‘vision’, I recognise a portal to the Earth Plane. I'll have to ask her about that later – where exactly it was and what she might know of the portal and where precisely it leads, at least.

[[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]]’s vision shows how not to die in the desert. Plain, but useful. The imagery teaches us of two different types of cactus: one is edible, one is poisonous. The differentiations in root structures and clusters of the spikes are what tells them apart, apparently! [Insert a messy sketch here]

The next door opened as a result, so off we go to see what secrets the following chamber holds!
