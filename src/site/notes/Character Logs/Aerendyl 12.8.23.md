*[Session 8] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

We faced yet another near-death experience today in our quest to cleanse the library of the demon roaming its hall. Even fighting together, our attacks barely fazed the [[summoned_demon.PNG|demon]]. Its claws and fangs tore into us, dropping [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] to the ground broken and bloodied, with myself near enough following. I feared our number was up. [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Professor Ssimmia Hakani\|Professor Hakani]], [[Tallie\|Tallie]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] joined the fray, with the latter helping us heal our wounds before any of us would cross over _permanently_.

In a last desperate act, I summoned the power of nature and ripped the demon's head clean off with a thorn whip, after which its body disintegrated before our eyes. We had won, but just barely. After picking up our unconscious allies, we retreated to the living quarters to recover over a meal prepared by our host, [[Xilo\|Xilo]].

Over the meal, we satisfied our curiosity about each other's pasts and the like. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] revealed her Shadar Kai heritage for the first time upon being … confronted, perhaps, about the dark, powdery substance substituting for blood in her body. Quite normal and not at all alarming, apparently.

We also took a less-hurried look at [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]]’ forearm, revealing what had up until now remained hidden beneath his sleeves. Obsidian formations there now lay surrounded with magical veins of swirling oranges, reds and yellows, resembling lava flows. It brought to mind fire genasi and even magma para-genasi — some elemental force must be at play here. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] did mention that given our presence in a place of dragon worship, perhaps it was one of the five dragon spirits. [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Pyra\|Pyra]], maybe? But to what end?

The more questions I ask, the more unknowns I end up with.

The markings on [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]]’ amulet were also an object of curiosity during our meal. Upon inspection, I recognised protective runes etched into the grand arches of [[Stratera University\|Stratera University]] back home in [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall]]. In that particular case, they supplemented [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Lady Sunnis\|Lady Sunnis]]' protection, meant specifically to off-set any seismic and sonic damage before it can occur.

[[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Nightbloom]] perused the text in kind, at one point even humming a few harmonic notes. She revealed the notation system was some kind of astral musical script used to record the language, which is actually sung and whistled. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] seemed quite fascinated — which is only fair, given that his fate has been tied to whatever resides in that amulet. All I know is that the entity is called [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]].

I left [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Nightbloom]] to their work,  throwing myself back onto the translation of my father’s diary. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] were already off to an adjacent chamber to work on learning how to handle a dagger (with [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] being the obvious teacher). This left me to pore over the infernal texts alone, which, to no one’s surprise, yielded me absolutely no new insights.

Once we’d all rested up and filled our bellies, we returned to the blood sigil in the library. We knew that, if fed the sacrifice of a soul, it would open a portal to the abyss. The more often the portal opened, the more stable it would become until remaining permanently open after enough activations.

We also knew it could be destroyed by holy water, but had none available to us. Before we could plan our next move to find some, or seek an alternative cleansing method, [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] seemed compelled to offer her draconic blood, gripped by an urge from the dagger – _gifted_ by [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Tiamat\|Tiamat]]? – she obtained. Though we pleaded for her to stop, she proceeded as intended all the same. Her reckless gambit left her drained white as a ghost, and her blood was swallowed by the sigil ( to no further horrendous effect, fortunately ). In frustrated rage, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] stormed off.

We then scrambled to collect all sharp objects as her body drained of colour, hoping to avoid any more "accidents" that might continue fuelling this evil portal.

Hardly any sooner than that, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]'s cry of "Emergency at the stairs!" rang out from the stairwell …
