*Session 12 and 13*
23rd of Bloomweave, (Maybe?) 515 of 3A.
*Day 1 in the Feywilds*

  I’m in the Feywilds! The last time I thought about this place was when I was a girl, listening to stories Mama told me of the Ni’Tessine summer home in Melianmar, of visiting Eladrin and the long nights of dancing. But Melianmar is tied to the Summer Court, and I’m here in Winter.
  Which means we should be careful. I’ve gone with the Sunstar alias, and my companions have all chosen one as well: Aerendyl is Kohatu, Corvaux is Varus, Thaddeus is Ted Barney, and Runa is Anur.
  Corvaux had a bit of an… episode when we first arrived in Mosskarm, mistaking sulfur for the Pale Blight. Thaddeus has made quite the impression on the locals. I look forward to seeing which of us first pops our cherry, so to speak, with the Fae.
  We shopped around for some supplies. I got a set of bone dice; might spend some time “fixing” them up. It might be best to keep my scams on the low for now. I’m awfully tricksy, but the Fae are better. Maybe I’ll learn something…
*Below are two sketches: one of the bone dice, and one of the tiefling Pride, surrounded by butterlfies and hearts, saying: "Ooh, Teddy, gimme a kiss"*

Speaking of learning something, we’ve set up in the Crimson Inn here in Mosskarm. While the genasi, half-elf, and I sat down to a game with a Pixie, Dex, Runa spoke with the innkeeper about the poachers they’re looking for. Whatever they said, it earned us a fine reward of booze. I sipped it, but some of my companions drank it down like they were dying of thirst. So much for caution.
Whatever disappointment I felt in the other two, I was deeply impressed by Thaddeus. He and I managed to convince Dex to part with some more information about [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]] and anyone associated with them.
We got the drunkards into a room to sleep it off, though both of them seem keen on **fighting** it off instead. Gods help Corvaux if fighting turns to… you know.
I took some time to case the inn. I know that Runa disapproves of my methods, so it’s better if I do this on my own, at least until I know the others a bit better. I found a group of Sun Elves & Eladrin. They called me “Vari”—they’re Summerlings, refugees. My group of weirdos are now conveniently refugees ourselves. I had to double-down on a lie, but I got a great deal of information. The Spring court is in turmoil, the land turned into a battlefield. I don’t know exactly what’s going on, but if there’s chaos, **he’s** likely hiding in it.
Good thing to know: Corvaux is quick to back up a lie. We’re in-laws for the duration of our time here—she’s the beloved sister to my dearly departed husband. I don’t know what made me say it. No, I do. I just can’t think about it now. It won’t change anything.

 I thought of Paelias while in reverie. Of wiping his snotty nose when he cried after scraping up his knee, of putting him to bed while Mama and Rodan went out. I remembered… I remembered how it ended. It will never leave me.

Corvaux saw. Gods damn her back to wherever she came from. She saw. She was kind, sitting beside me and talking about it. She tried to comfort me, to tell me there is nothing to be ashamed of, gnawing on myself like an animal. She doesn’t understand. She cannot understand.
I’m the only one in my wretched bloodline to know shame. It’s the only thing that keeps me from turning out like *There is a large splotch of ink here, where a pen was pressed to the point of breaking.*

**I am the harbinger of my own fate. I will not chew my nails.
I will not ache for this. I am the harbinger of my own fate. I will not chew my nails. I will not ache for this. I am the harbinger of my own fate. I will not chew my nails.**

**I will not ache for this. Not again.**
