*[Session 5] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

This entry will be a messy one, but I suppose all that matters is that it makes sense to me. So: we spoke to [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]], the one responsible for the upkeep and, I suppose, protection of the archive in [[Hystaa's Tower\|Hystaa's Tower]]. We discussed the dragon [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I saw — and apparently, [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] did, too, about three weeks prior to our encounter, quite a ways from here, by the [[Halls of Ancestry\|Halls of Ancestry]] up … north, I believe? I should confirm with [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] or [[Lady Liatrus\|Lady Liatrus]] sooner rather than later.

Our talks again yielded these images across the walls; like whatever we shared in conversation would have its visual counterpart projected onto the structures. It was an incredible watch.

At one point, the note that fell from one of the buildings that the dragon was hauling with him, was revealed to be millennia old — from a time where astral wyrms invaded the material plane, leaving glitches in the fabric of reality at their points of entry.

Hardly any sooner in this overwhelming flurry of revelations, [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]] revealed a framed painting of what turned out to be the [[Halls of Ancestry\|Halls of Ancestry]] in the [[Basalt Caverns \|Basalt Caverns ]]of my home plane. That area was far away from [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall City]], nearer the border of the [[Fire Plane\|Fire Plane]], and burrowed deep underground. I've only heard of it, unfortunately.

Alongside the [[Basalt Caverns\|Basalt Caverns]], three other areas host ( apparently less ‘famous’ ) [[Halls of Ancestry\|Halls of Ancestry]]:

- one floats the astral sea, to be found via astral projection (think about it long enough and you’ll get there), and the lair of a solar dragon, apparently;
- one in the the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]];
- and one on [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Rakāuvi\|Rakāuvi]], which was in south [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Sylvari]], but has since moved to [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Baheera\|Baheera]].

[[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]] revealed these Halls are shrines to the draconic parents and five dragon spirits, as well as a way of preserving draconic history — feats, battles, blood lines, et cetera, as well as records of those that have done or would do grievous harm to dragons.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] revealed that this dragon they sighted at the [[Halls of Ancestry\|Halls of Ancestry]] (formerly in [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Sylvari]]) was called ‘The Old One’? It might have been a protector of that site and decided to leave – with half the construction in tow?! – upon being besieged by thieves and other such rotten folk. At least, that's what I managed to cobble together while listening to [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]]’ explanation.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I also asked about the yellow dust we found near [[Tornwing Haven\|Tornwing Haven]] and all that entailed. [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]] tells us about the [[Terms and phrases/Pale Blight\|Pale Blight]], named by a myconid of the autumn court in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]. [[Juniper\|Juniper]]. It was brought to the forest of the [[Silver Maple\|Silver Maple]] deliberately; fissures in the fabric of reality led to the [[Locations/Abyss/Abyss\|Abyss]], where the blight bled through, and demons, too, would enter this plane through.

Once the [[archfey\|archfey]] ruling over the forest had been deliberately crippled by her enemy, she sealed off her forest from within to prevent the spread of the Blight. It stayed sealed for 20 years – until a group of heroes from the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] began to decipher what had happened, including Juniper, apparently … could this be how it wound up so close to [[Tornwing Haven\|Tornwing Haven]]? Where else might it have since spread?

I shared with [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]] that we detected the blight by [[Tornwing Haven\|Tornwing Haven]], for posterity’s sake. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] shared the recipe for the antidote, in return for which the recipe from the [[Locations/Feywild/Autumn/Autumn\|Autumn]] Court shows up on the wall behind [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]]. They tell us they’ll be in touch if they find any new information about [[Terms and phrases/Pale Blight\|the Blight]].

Before we departed the library at last, [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]] tells us the hexagonal token works as a sending stone of sorts, and that the tokens’ capacities will expand over time. Something to keep an eye on! 

Upon returning to the first chamber of the tower, we found [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] again. She was different than how I remembered her — folded into herself, as if in some sort of shock. Humbled, even. Once we asserted she was well enough to travel and willing to come with us, we set out. I'll spare any future finders of this diary the details, so in short: we decided to set out for the ruins straight away to stay ahead of the approaching storm.

Upon arrival at the ruins after a ( fortunately! ) fairly uneventful trek,[[ Lady Liatris\| Lady Liatris]] opened herself up to us to a surprising extent, apologising for any offence she may have caused. It was a brief heart-to-heart in the end, but I was grateful to have been included in it. To cap the conversation off, she even gave each of us a scale off her own tail — a gesture I expect is more significant amongst her kind than I could really know.

We set off as a group after that, towards the hole. I ( unsurprisingly ) got sidetracked by a dancing figure. It seems a ritual, like she's casting magic – transmutation, as it turned out. The structure of the statue she was circling around shifted with every touch.  After I try to strike up a conversation with her to ask about it, a nearby worker revealed that she won't tell me what her ritual – I presume – is about; she's faithful to the [[Tides of Silence\|Tides of Silence]], a group of mystics interested in the deep dragon (some type of water dragon?), which I assume means she took an oath of silence? 

With my curiosity somewhat sated, I joined the rest and we ventured down the hole via the platform (safer that way, especially for [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] after she took two falls trying to climb out of the tower just hours prior …). The air was ( and is ) different, cold and humid; the darkness is too ominous for my liking. 

There's all manner of things to see in the chamber we just wound up in. A statue of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], a passage with sand dunes layered about it, stairs leading farther down, a huge archways, and a subterranean lake … Now, off to explore all these areas!
