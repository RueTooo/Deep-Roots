*Session log ‚Äì diary entry style ‚Äì for Aeren‚Äôs first session on 21/09/2023! (I‚Äôll fix any bad formatting once I‚Äôm on my pc üò¨)*

‚Äî

Today was the day I left my home in [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall]], and set out on my journey to seek out the Stonecutter ‚Äì starting in the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Hallowhymn/Hallowhymn\|Hallowhymn]]s on [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/RakƒÅuvi\|RakƒÅuvi]], with the intent to venture on to [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]]. Luca's troop of vendors and guards was a formidable one. I'd never seen bulletes as tame as the ones pulling the carts!

The subterranean passageway towards the portal held more wonders still. One could argue I should be used to the wonders of this elemental plane of ours, but the swirling sands and the large, shimmering mithril cobblestone that made up the path and the coloured, swirling sands were magnificent to behold. Perhaps it was sentimentality reigning supreme and making my admiration so overt...

The impracticality of the path's structure unfortunately meant one of the carts got stuck, and not long after, one of us fell and injured herself. As it turned out, this tunnel housed ravenous sands ‚Äî and they‚Äôre known to thirst for whatever blood they might find. A single drop was enough to draw them our way.

A stumbling start to the fight that ensued eventually led to our victory, but poor [[Stox\|Stox]], the satyr merchant, almost perished for it. [[Vigil\|Vigil]], a [[tiefling\|tiefling]] that (like myself) joined this convoy as a guard, helped me rid [[Stox\|Stox]] of the monstrosity, fortunately.

It was welcome twist to what could‚Äôve been a grim ending of the first leg of the journey, but I don't have the words to describe the next chapter.

**[[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Hallowhymn/Hallowhymn\|HALLOWHYMN]]**. What a sight! I've never seen earth float so high, over a vast ocean many leagues below. The sky was bluer than any crystal I've ever laid eyes upon, and the clouds in the distance towered to mind-boggling heights, appearing reflections of ice-capped mountain peaks. The trees on the floating islands produced songs with the shifting winds. Turns out they have holes in their trunks ‚Äì who would have thought?!

As my awe subsided into relief, [[Vigil\|Vigil]] sought me out to give me a parting gift: an amber pendant of warmth, to keep the cold of the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]] mountains ‚Äì my next destination ‚Äì at bay. He won't be joining me there; other destinations await him. I don't know if the battle, the gesture or both have instilled me with a sadness to part ways with him, but I hope to see him again someday.

For now, I must find myself either a kite to glide down to [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]] at the risk of plummeting to my death, or find passage on a ship ‚Ä¶
