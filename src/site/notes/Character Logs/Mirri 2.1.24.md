*Session 16, part 2 of 3*
*Still Day 3 in the Feywilds*

Just when I thought the day was going well. We landed in a fight with the poachers that [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]’s been searching for. They had the benefits of invisibility, or something like it. I managed to hear them coming, at least, though the damage I did was minimal at best. At least I got some money out of it.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] got hurt. Badly. I’d hoped some playful flirting and a gift of platinum might… I don’t know what it would have helped. I don’t know at all. I need to be **useful** to these people… or at the very least entertaining. I can do entertaining. I can do fun.

While we were recovering, taking shelter in the camp we raided, our dear [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] revealed that he has been courting the idea of deals with devils in the hopes that it might free them from the Pact. I didn’t really get a chance to process the insanity of it before [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] tore him a new one and stormed off.

I managed to convince my fellow warlock to be patient. I know he’s scared, I know he’s desperate. I’ve been there and I’ve suffered for it. But something they said… something about trading something to [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]] in return for their soul. I felt [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow\|Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow]]’s fear and distress at the very **thought** of the question.

I don’t like this. I don’t like it at all. We need to get somewhere safe, back to some sort of civilization. I need to sleep, properly sleep. *There are things [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow\|Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow]] and I need to discuss.* I know **he** has a hand in this, somehow, and if he doesn’t… he would at least know where to start looking.

That is not a thought I should **ever** entertain. It’s as insane as [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] wanting [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]] to break his pact. And it’s certainly not a thought I can voice aloud, knowing what I know now. I saw [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] crush the skull of that [[Drow\|Drow]]. I’ve heard [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]’s verbal assault. [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] seemed to sit peacefully out of the way, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t capable of the same violence as the rest of us.

I doubt that they’d enjoy my secrets. I’m loath to admit it, but it’s not just shame keeping my tongue tied. It’s **fear.**
