*Session 14 Days 22 - 23? of Bloomweave?, year 515 T.A.?*

We left the [[Businesses/Crimson Inn\|Crimson Inn]] and followed [[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Trisandra]], or [[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Tris]], as she led us out of [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]] using quieter paths. These were somewhat difficult to traverse, but they provided a beautiful view of the city. Outside, the sky was an indigo blue, lit by thousands of crystals that gave the impression of a night sky, along with an enormous moon that resembled the one from the Material Plane but was twice as large.

Approaching the exit, we encountered guards for the first time. They wore masks attached to their helmets and stood motionless, like statues, beside the giant doors that intermittently opened slightly to allow passage.

Finally, we stepped out into the cold. I braced myself against the blast of freezing air, a sensation I'd become somewhat familiar with during my time in [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]]. [[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Tris]] set a brisk pace, leading us through the vast, pale landscape that made me feel small and brought to mind tales of the Water Plane’s icy expanses.

The journey took us three to four hours until we sought refuge inside a hollowed-out snow dome. [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] shared the story of her tattoos—ink that appeared one day, making her easier to track — likely linked to her patron, I suspect, whom has been in her life for five decades, apparently.

Somehow, I let [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] talk me into trying to woo [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]. She was not particularly impressed by my attempt and in hindsight, neither am I. Henceforth, I think I’ll leave the wooing up to others.

When we resumed our travel from the dome, [[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Tris]] said we had another hour or two left and warned of a toll we'd have to pay when passing through lands scarred by war, where disturbing the dead was forbidden. In this region, crypts were well-maintained, and the dead were respected equally to the living. Winter here had a deep connection with death, welcoming the undead and honouring [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/The Raven Queen\|The Raven Queen]].

[[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Tris]] led us underground where, inside a cavern, she made a bloody offering to the red fungi – or redcaps, rather, stressing the importance of silence to avoid disturbing them. [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] and I made our own offering, intent on not stirring any trouble unnecessarily.

We discovered a shrine illuminated by a massive statue with wings ([[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Faen\|Faen]]) and surrounded by nine tombs adorned with symbols of various gods. With some guidance from [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Tris]], we learned that the tombs served as markers or memorials for those interred in the ice below.

Returning to the surface, we crossed a stream and found a massive hole in the ground (almost reminiscent of the one I found [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] in mere days ago …), beyond which lay remnants of a camp. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] suggested setting a trap here and taking a rest while we waited for said trap to be sprung.

[[Entities/NPCs/Trisandra\|Tris]], before taking her leave, handed [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] a feather from Puck's crest as an identifier to the [[Akelings\|Akelings]] and departed on her own journey. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] took responsibility for the night watch, while the rest of us selected a covered spot to wait out the next few hours.
