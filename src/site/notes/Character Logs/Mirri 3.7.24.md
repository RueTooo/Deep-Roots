*Day 6 in the Feywilds*

We’ve arrived in the [[Scarlet City\|Scarlet City]], the last city in [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Winter\|Winter]] before we head into [[Locations/Feywild/Autumn/Autumn\|Autumn]]. What awe at the beauty I saw there, from the twisting branches of the massive tree at the heart of the city to the colors of fall, was soon overshadowed by the fact that the ***[[Entities/Factions/Crimson Gaze\|Crimson Gaze]]*** was docked here.

The Gaze! That beautiful ruby beauty! I couldn’t believe my eyes, but there she was, just as incredible as she was the last time I saw her. Oh, to think that I had been so young that first time, stuttering out my very first alias to get myself aboard. My first proper drink, my first proper kiss… Ember. That was her name. I remember her like it was yesterday. She had the most incredible eyes.

And I remember the friends I went with, the Moon Rats like myself who had heard every story, no matter how outrageous, same as me. There was Ros, Caper, and Eilonwy . Funny, to think back on them now. I wonder where they are now, how they are doing. I heard Ros and Eilonwy were married at some point, but we had moved in with Rodan by then and I was too busy caring for Paelias to slip away to attend. Not that I think either of them would want their ex-girlfriend at their wedding, all things considered.
Regardless, I did not hesitate to relay to my companions how desperately I wanted to visit the ship. I could have waxed poetic for hours. Before we went out, we stopped by the inn, [[Froggit About It\|Froggit About It]], and there, [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]], [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]], and [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] decided they would much rather sleep than explore. Their loss! [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I made for the shops, grabbing more suitable outfits for such a grand occasion. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] declined a change of clothes, but I could hardly care when [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] appeared looking like ***that.*** Gods save me, I might require a room to myself before the night is over. I haven’t… well, I cannot say I haven’t *indulged* since my last great heartache, but pathetic one-night-stands have never sated me. If [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] asks, though, the answer is a resounding yes.

I found myself tongue-tied as soon as we stepped aboard. It was overwhelming, standing on those red decks again, feeling like a giddy teen. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]], [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]], and I all agreed to a fight, providing entertainment and hoping to win a bit of coin, too. I kept an eye on [[Entities/NPCs/Jinx\|Jinx]] while we waited for our turn. I hope… I hope this place inspires in her what it did in me all those decades ago. If there is any place in any plane of existence where she might be safe from both the poachers and him, it would be here.

I must speak with the captain before the night is done. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]’s fight starts soon. This should be a night to remember.
