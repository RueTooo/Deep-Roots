Session 20 **Day 26 of Bloomweave, Year 515 T.A.?**
*in which aeren decides to use everyone’s actual names again both because he himself gets confused + to confuse any strangers that might come across his diary, gods forbid*

[[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]] and I gathered a hefty share of food from the larder before we joined the others, upon which I was tasked with creating an opening around the bars of some type of cell (these fools didn't account for a genasi!), granting [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] access to a figure huddled within — battered and weak, but our fighter-friend's approach radiated concern and tenderness. For a few moments there, I couldn't help but ponder the relationship between the two, and I was made to think of those whom I went my letters to before we set out for the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]].

The place prevented us from aiding the stranger, later introduced as [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]], with magic, unfortunately, so we resolved to vacate the area post-haste to tend to her ailments properly. The goblin child that lingered in the corner, [[Entities/NPCs/Jinx\|Jinx]], agreed to join us in our retreat.

As we prepared to leave, our conversation turned to [[Spite\|Spite]], a tiefling mage apparently all to eager to live up to his name, had stoked in the tower. His 'floor' loomed with ill repute. The stranger tranger led us to a chamber that held a personal artifact – a cord with a pendant – that she swiftly reclaimed.

We swiftly left this demi-plane then and, once settled, [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]] provided a potion for [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] in a finely crafted goblet — special in some way, as he insisted it be returned to him after use. News of being in the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]] startled her, but she swiftly mustered resolve, speaking of acquaintances in the Summer Court we might seek out. [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] recounted her past — a captain who once stood sentinel against corruption at the Ironwood Citadel.

 [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]]'s tale unfolded as she wrapped herself in [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]'s bedroll, managing her own care while [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirri]] divulged her pursuit of [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]] in time — a name [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] recognized with a scowl. 

The discourse darkened further when hellfire weaponry and their devastating potential were brought forth by [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirri]], who apparently found some in the unnamed demi-plane we just left (I *still* suspect it is somehow tied to [[Locations/Hell/Malbolge\|Malbolge]] …). The weapons' power to sunder reality itself brought forth an inevitable discussion as to what next to do with the pack. We debated its fate, ultimately deciding to contain its threat within [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]'s own enchanted bag for the time being. Despite the risk, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]], took the decisive step, leaving us startled, but unscathed.

With preparations complete, we departed from our temporary cave haven, but not without another encounter with the whimsical pixies. To earn our passage, I recounted the story of my transformation, [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets\|Da'yin Kuya]]'s aid in helping me become who I was meant to be, and at what personal cost. Thankfully, the pixies seemed to accept my tale — at least I received no warning to essentially 'do better' next time.

Our passage paid by stories and teeth, we left the mountains with minds and hearts set upon the realm of [[Locations/Feywild/Autumn/Autumn\|Autumn]]. Our journey continues, the weight of our task and the newfound companionship of [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] urging us forwards.
