20th of Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.

A friend in the Guild tipped me off—someone matching [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]]'s description was seen near Jasmine’s Cliff with three others. My friend tailed them until they disappeared into the woods. Note to self: I owe them a drink.
I set out immediately and ran into two others on the road to the Felderwisp Farm—a cleric and a warrior. They made horrendous noise, all heavy armor and chainmail, so I slipped off on my own to get a better vantage point. My two “companions” made their way into the farm cabin, taking on the two guards, and I seized my chance to slip upstairs and corner whoever was waiting up there. I Charmed him and finally, after all of these years, got some answers: he was communing with someone named [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]] in a place called the [[Fallen Halls of Eristalon\|Fallen Halls of Eristalon]].
The cleric, **Halek**, was looking for a girl, the daughter of the farmers who lived here, whose blood coated the walls of their home. The half-orc was against me killing the cultists outright, as if they deserved any sort of mercy. Regardless, I stripped them bare and pocketed their daggers to sell later. I may not have been allowed to slit their throats, but I could, at least, humiliate them. From there, we headed to the barn, where I found a tiefling and a strange elf in a cage. I cleaved the tiefling’s mind in two with Dissonant Whispers and we managed to free the caged man, **Malachi**.

He knew the bastard’s name! He said he had last seen him in the **Staterra University in Sandfall City** on the Earth Plane. Finally! A lead!
In a shrine on the property, we found the child, Nettie. The half-orc, Runa, comforted the child with the scrappy Tressym kitten she’d found in the barn. Nettie is a brave child, but gods know she shouldn’t have to be. She should never have had to endure this. No one should. She will be safe in the city, at least, and the local clerics can seal the rift to the Abyss here. It was open to the **108th layer…** add that to my research list for when I next find a library.
Halek and I spoke about what I had learned from the cultist and he offered to send myself and my new… friend, Runa, to an Archive, where we might find someone who can help, someone who knows how I can get to that university. Here’s hoping, at least.

[Below are two small sketches: one of the cage that Malachi (sic) was placed in, and the other of Runa's Tressym.]
