*session 15 day 23 of bloomweave, year 515 of 3a.*
*any spelling mistakes are in character ❤️*
we set up camp by the big hoe. managed to get some rest at last. thought of that rhemoraz monster kept hauntin me, but ef that thing was a poacher's prize, wouldn't be the strangest thing i heard. woke up to cold snow, but the borrealis took some sting off it. pretty to look at, especially with those two moons hanging in the sky. folk always talkin' 'bout how the big moon changes them lycanthropes, but most can't make heads or tails of that smaller moon, lucanthis. all I know is, sometimes it feels like it gives a body a bit extra somethin'.

dunno why [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|corvo]] thought makin snow people of all us was a good idea. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|tadeus]] seem to like messin with magic too, threw some invisibility nonsense on [[Animal Companions/Obsidian\|sid]], and that made the fool sprout wings. [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|miri]] tried her own trick on [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|corvo]], but seemed to fizzle out.

started searchin round the campsite, found a crate, inside was a coat - not any coat, but something [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|tanix]] would wear. my heart dropped a little, miss that old orc. took a stab at findin the leader of them poachers, used a spell to find his dagger. felt a real odd sprouting start on my head - bloody antlers. found some useful stuff too tho, rations, tinder box, rope, cloak.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|miri]] got curious bout why i'm after poachers. didn't feel like spillin my guts, so i kept it vage carried on. tryin to track that poacher leader again, gives me the creeps that dagger movin off on itsown.

we tread carefully through the middle tunnel, and what do we find? campsite with corpses of creatures, tentacles, and one real ugly elf crawling out a tent. knew that face, was there when we lost [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|tanix]]. my blood boiled hotter than any dragons breath. didn't take much, lopped his head clean off. his comrades fell soon after, except for that dwarf woman. managed to land one good hit before she poofed away. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|tadeus]] used some spell to make her calm so he could ask questions but i didnt want to hear it. none of them deserve to live.

kept feelin that bloody dagger move, closer then further away. it means we have to hurry. i managed to score 3000 silvers off these evil bastards so at least theres that.
