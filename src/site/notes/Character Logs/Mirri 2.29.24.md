*End of Day 5 in the Feywilds*

Our mysterious songbird was a little goblin child. While [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] explored the larder to replace our rations, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I slipped into the shadows, exploring the other rooms. I found a forge containing many magical things, including flail snail eggs and a strange metal I could not identify. It looked rusted, but it radiated heat. I decided it was best to be cautious and avoid touching it until the others could look for themselves. I packed the eggs and some of the notes into my bag. The notes were either written in a cypher or in Infernal, neither of which I could understand at that moment.

The goblin child, [[Entities/NPCs/Jinx\|Jinx]], was singing to a prisoner, someone by the name of [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]]. Someone that [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] knew.

I know nothing of the [[Orcish\|Orcish]] tongue, know nothing of what they said to each other, but I do not have to. I understand. I understand so thoroughly it makes me heartsick. We are more alike than I believed us to be, [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] and I. I understand the violence they have inflicted upon these poachers better than anyone. I know what pain they have endured in silence, their reluctance to speak of it save to ask for help in killing the people who took everything from them.

[[Entities/NPCs/Jinx\|Jinx]] was frightened of us, all of us, and I can tell that she has been treated cruelly by the poachers who operate here. [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] informed us that [[Dain’s Prison\|Dain’s Prison]] is a demi-plane that belongs to a tiefling wizard called ***[[Spite\|Spite]].*** I wasted no time insisting that we leave as soon as possible. Another mage like ***him*** is the last thing we need.

On our way out, I swore I could see a face in the flames of the braziers we passed. I stole the ledger bearing our names—if what I saw was real, if our trespass was noticed, I’d rather not hand the bastard our identities to make it easier to find us.

We rested for a while, allowing [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] some time to recover. She is a former Captain of the Wall, guarding [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Sylvari]] from the [[Yew Forest\|Yew Forest]]. To my surprise, she knew of ***him*** and said that he had been thrown out of the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Ironwood Citadel\|Ironwood Citadel]] several times. Though I have hunted him across all of [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Sylvari]], it still shocks me how infamous he truly is… and it infuriates me to know how long he has gotten away with so much.

I had been trying to distract myself by making tea and caring for the little one. [[Entities/NPCs/Jinx\|Jinx]] insisted she is not a child, she’s 16. [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck]] was shocked to learn my age, as if 112 is not only a decade out from standard elven adulthood & [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] is senior to me, is she not?
Our playful banter soon turned serious and we argued about what to do with the bag. I was in favor of laying a trap, but in the end, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] placed it into their bag of holding.
We packed up camp, once again setting course for Autumn. We met the pixies again and I admit, I could not come up with another tale for the life of me. Carrying [[Entities/NPCs/Jinx\|Jinx]] on my back reminded me of happier times, of days filled with sunshine and laughter, of [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]] begging me to do the trick with my ears. I haven’t done it in decades. I wonder if I even still can. In any case, I paid little attention to the pixies and their games. I only hope it doesn’t come back to bite me in the ass, as most things do.

[[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Scarlet Maple\|The Scarlet City]] awaits, yet I am torn between excitement and dread. No, not dread. Homesick. Heartsick.

It is no one’s fault but ***his,*** but still… it hurts. It aches deep down inside me to know that there is no reunion like [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Tanis\|Tanis]] waiting for me when this is done.

Save one. And I do not plan on letting him leave alive.
