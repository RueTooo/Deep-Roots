*Session log for Aeren's 3rd session, with [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]!*

Day 19 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age.

Two days ago, on the 17th, I set out along the [[Ghastbane Cliffs\|Ghastbane Cliffs]], my home for the past decade, in pursuit of insight into the reports of trees and other flora having been destroyed beyond repair. The Moonshade moss has been flourishing, at least — I remember wondering if that might have to do [[Lucanthum\|Lucanthum]]’s turquoise shine during its rotation across the sky, before I came across a mangled tree at last.

It was as though a massive paw had crushed it. Large, wide-footed tracks of some beast with four legs led this way and that around it. Something reptilian came through this way … I couldn’t stop to consider it for long, as a shrill whistling noise passed overhead, and the earth trembled with a force I’ve not felt the immense rock slides and avalanches I witnessed in the northern mountain peaks of [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]].

The only thing there was to do, was to follow the quaking to its source, farther towards [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Baheera\|Baheera]] still. A pile of boulders that have never once moved in all the times I have crossed this area, has shifted, revealing odd markings. In hindsight, I wish I could have more closely examined them — but the gaping hole in the ground some ways off more urgently called for my attention.

A cloud of ash (I assume) hung all over and about it. It was so dense at first, I didn’t even notice the person hiding below it, before going off the examine the odd, feather-like patterns the ash seemed to fall into on the ground.

The stranger, [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]], revealed herself to me. I admit, I thought her a strange one at first, speaking of delusions — assuming *I* was a delusion, and one of ‘the wrong kind of yellow’ at that! She seemed unfamiliar with even the most mundane parts of this world. The sky, the sun, the concept of rain and rivers — all new to her. Surely enough, she revealed she isn’t from here, and doesn’t quite know how she got here, either.

But things got more interesting, still. Again I heard the noise and felt the trembling, and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I set out together to chase it to its source (as I did not wish to leave her behind here). We come across a river, plummeting down a waterfall. I know this area well, but not the odd creatures populating the area. At first glance, they seemed a simple bear and a toad, but they shone with a yellow, powdery substance I could not place …

The bear was not responsive to my magic in the sense that I’m used to, either. Where I would usually be able to have some semblance of a conversation with a bear such as itself, this one simply parroted my words right back to me. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] revealed her suspicions as my unease grew: these animals were infected with ***something*** she’s witnessed in her home.

We couldn’t let these animals go unchecked, and let this infection spread. Though it pained me at first to kill these creatures, it turned out they were no animals at all — I don’t know what to call them, still, but they were insectoid … unknowns. They dissolved after the fight, leaving but their yellow stains on the ground.

Unfortunately, one of them got to me; infected me with its poison. The itch all throughout my body was indescribable, and I don’t know if I’d have ever gotten rid of it without [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]’s help. She brewed an antidote of Moonshade (or Moonshadow!) moss – or two, actually – and taught me the recipe for it. It should serve as protection from any future poisoning if imbibed ahead of time, too.

Once I’d recovered enough to carry on, we decided to excavate the infected soil and deposit it in a wheelbarrow. There was no knowing whether it might spread through the ground, and that was not a risk I was willing to take. We depart towards the [[Circle of Seven\|Circle of Seven]] to find my peers that have specialised in purification rituals and the like, so they may learn of this new threat and find out how to prevent its spread, should the worst come to pass and more of these creatures turn out to be about.

Along the way, we felt and heard another rumble and for a moment, the sun disappeared from the sky. Something flew overhead, something *massive*, holding what turned out to be buildings in its mighty claws! [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] recovered a piece of paper that fell from one such building and recognised the script as Draconic. The creature, meanwhile, ventured farther south and into [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Baheera\|Baheera]]. I feared for [[Tornwing Haven\|Tornwing Haven]]’s safety, so we sped there as fast as we could without throwing about the infected soil.

Thankfully, the settlement was unharmed, but its citizens were disturbed by the sighting I just described. Little did they know of my (and likely [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]’s?!) suspicions that this incident and the infection *must* be related to each other. Coincidences exist, but none of this magnitude. They can’t.

At length, we started gathering more information about what the locals saw. I reached out to my circle and local clerics to help us cleanse the earth. Meanwhile, I took what time in between I had to recover from my wounds and monitor the purification of the earth. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] passed on the recipe for the antidote, and shortly after, we set off into the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Baheera\|Baheera]] desert to seek more answers.

So far, we’ve been led to a place that is believed cursed. Lovely!
