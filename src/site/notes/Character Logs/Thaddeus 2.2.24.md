Personal Diary, Entry 47, 23rd/24th? of Bloomwave, Year 515

*This entry has been written, erased, and written again so many times that sections of it are difficult to make out. The handwriting is much more shaky than how Thaddeus typically writes.*

*Read ahead at your own risk, the spoiler tagged sections include secrets that have not and currently cannot be shared in character. In character, if you were somehow able to get your hands on Thaddeus' diary, these sections seem to be entirely gibberish.*

Our rest ended with some shock, I spotted one of those warped pixies staring at me and soon after received images from Sid of a creature rising from the lava to grab them. I quickly dismissed Sid so he would remain safe, and was going to run straight for him until something began to happen with Corvaux as well.

||However, the moment between rising panic and action was much much longer for me. As we all ran, I found myself somewhere entirely different in just one step. A library of sorts, wide assortment of books, paintings depicting various stills of scenery. Including, the perspective I had just before I found myself here. A painting of my friends running to check on Corvaux, painted as if it was looking through my eyes running behind Mirri. A devil named Epiphany sat in the library, and snapped a book closed as I appeared here.||

||In short, they served a ruler of one of the layers of hell, while I was here they asked me of my current struggles. I, regrettably, couldn't stop myself and told them everything that has been weighing on my mind with this pact. That I more than wanted a way out, I *needed* it. Strangely, when I spoke Ted's name it came out in Abyssal. Epiphany recoiled like I had struck her when I spoke that name, said they haven't heard it in a long time. They disappeared for a few minutes afterwards, I summoned Sid and inspected the paintings. I found nothing interesting. When Epiphany returned, negotiations began.||

||I want to return to my normal life. I could never do that if anything or anybody could still lay claim to my soul or any other part of me. So I made it immediately clear during the negotiations that my soul was not on the table. I had many stipulations, all to ensure I would have a clean severance from this contract and my pact by the end of it all. Most importantly to me, I was not going to betray my moral code any farther than I already was just speaking to this devil. Epiphany's patron wanted "beautiful souls", I quickly contested the notion until it was explained that this didn't necessarily mean nice or good souls. There are very much souls already bound for the hells that this devil would call beautiful.||

||I was asked to collect 3 of these souls. I felt torn, which concerned me the most. I know in my heart that the morally correct thing to have done here was deny speaking or negotiating with the devil in the slightest. But I was too scared. I don't want to betray myself, or Corvaux who had *just* gotten me to realize how foolish I'm acting, nor betray anyone else. But what is my future if I didn't? I could go home, leave behind my party and wait for whatever fate would befall me. I could look for another way out of my pact, but be forced to almost constantly use this pact magic just to survive with no real idea on how quickly this will lead to my success or failure as Zirels vessel. How quickly it will lead to my death.||

||I don't know what I'm dealing with, I don't know how much time I have left, I don't know if there even is another way out of this pact. I'm desperate, I'm scared, and I'm overwhelmed. I asked constant clarifying questions, anything I could think of that I wanted to know or would maybe somehow make this an easier choice for me. I was strong enough to ask for 24 hours to think on it. Then I found myself focusing on the painting, and was running again like I had never left. Though I had a new ring, for when I was ready to decide.||

As it turned out, Corvaux was seeing bodies move. It's unclear why only they could see this, but they spoke in infernal calling out to their "lady". ||Thats what Epiphany called their patron, her lady, ruler of Malbolge.|| I suggested we simply leave as soon as possible, we eventually all agreed to follow this image of "golden oak" to autumn and search for Vestan. After a number of hours of travel, we came across an old campsite and a pair of fey inhabitants fearing over a pair of bags on the road. My mind was elsewhere however, and perhaps not as eloquently as I could've, I broached to the party my concerns about my pact as we set up camp. I've lately realized the lengths I am willing to go to be free of my pact, and I wanted to know what my party would say.

Of course, I couldn't get as specific as I liked. But Corvuax, even if they apologized later, made it very clear what their gut reaction would be. But all of their potential solutions are much too slow and unreliable, I love and appreciate that they were willing to help but I simply do not have the strength to push on much longer without ***guarantees.*** Corvaux's way out seems much more appealing every passing second, but I cannot do that to the people who love me, I cannot do that to my future. I twisted the new ring on my finger, and began to bleed.
