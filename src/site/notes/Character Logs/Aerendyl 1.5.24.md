*Session 12 Day 22 of Bloomwave(?), year 515 of the Third Age*
(Time works differently here. Who knows what date it might really be!)
Before the imminent departure to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|the Feywilds]], we take a moment to pen letters to those who hold a place of significance in our hearts. My heart clenches at the thought of never returning, of succumbing to the unknown, but the risk beckons us boldly. We choose paper birds as our messengers, capable of carrying our last words for up to fifty strides.

To [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|Malachai]], I scribe a letter sharing my path ahead—[[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|the Feywilds]]—and my resolve to find him in the wake of our endeavour's success or failure. And to [[Aoife\|Aoife]], I spill my gratitude for the wisdom she imparted upon me; the teachings that armoured my spirit for what lays ahead.

[[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]], with that pervasive air of mystery clouding him, transforms the passage, opening a doorway to [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]], our gateway to the other side. The space we step into bears significant resemblance to our departure point but embellished with a grander tree and an overall tidier presence. A [[Entities/NPCs/Library of Unseen Horizons/Caspian\|Caspian]] lookalike – [[Calahan\|Calahan]] – awaits us there, ready to reveal secrets etched into the walls at our questioning.

Their projections illustrate most of the [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Winter\|Winter]] Court, with fiery spheres that burst, magma flowing, and  two moons behind the [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]] peaks, one steadfast, one ever moving.

A myriad of plans sprout amidst us—gathering supplies, gathering whispers—while [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] advises caution, insisting on aliases to mask our true selves in this beguiling realm. And so the masks we don, adopting names not our own:

- [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aeren]] morphs into [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Kohatu]].
- [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Entities/Player Characters/Mirri]] transforms to [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]].
- [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] cloaks himself as [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted Barney]], with a third guise of [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Dath Lliuq]] secreted away.
- [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] reverses her name to [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]].
- And [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] reforges her name into [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]].

I offer the warmth of my amber orb that [[Vigil\|Vigil]] gifted me to [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]], sharing the flickering warmth as I hoist her upon my back.

We seek snow outside, only to be met with humid air, a landscape of rock, sunflowers embracing a river of magma—an underground city chiselled into the heart of a volcano, where steam and heat power machinations foreign yet intriguing. It's a steampunk rendition of the home I recall, complete with a bustling populace weaving through steam-absorbing verdure.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]'s touch upon a sunflower releases a yellow powder—sulfur, not the [[Terms and phrases/Pale Blight\|Pale Blight]] we feared. Apologies lodge in my throat as relief floods me; we are spared the encounter with that scourge.

Our steps lead us to an ink seller named [Pride], who directs us to the other needs of our voyage: [[Businesses/Crimson Inn\|Crimson Inn]], and a nearby hunter’s stall. [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] secures me a luxurious cloak from the hunter for some coin, for which I utter thanks in [[Languages/Sylvan\|Sylvan]], much to their undisguised delight.

At [[Flaming Fortune\|Flaming Fortune]], we might procure other trinkets of warmth, but likely not without draining our purses dry. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]'s act of learning [[Languages/Sylvan\|Sylvan]] that ensues is nothing short of a marvel; [[Entities/NPCs/Pride\|Pride]] imbues him with knowledge of the language through some type of arcane … ritual? Either way: I find myself inspired by it, but, admittedly, a touch envious as well.

We head to [[Businesses/Crimson Inn\|Crimson Inn]] at last with [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]’s new knowledge in tow. A stabby knife contest of some sort ensues at a table behind ours. This inn promises an odd form of camaraderie, and I note the [[genasi\|genasi]] across the way—a silent challenge flickers between us.

As [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] delves deeper into the contest, though, I cannot pass up the invitation to join ( to help further [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]’s pursuit of finding out more about [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]] ). [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] and I both lending our hands to the knives. Such games may veil more than meets the eye, transactions of information resting behind every throw.

With [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] by our sides at the table, I can now only hope I won’t lose yet another finger.
