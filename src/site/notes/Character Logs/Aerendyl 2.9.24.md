*Session 17 Day 24 of Bloomwave, year 515 T.A.?*
We rushed into the chamber following [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]]' alarm only to find nothing visible. I tried to investigate but got pulled back quickly by [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]]. That's when I felt it—a familiar but unnerving resonance in the air, like when the spirits of the [[Circle of Seven\|Circle of Seven]] would return. Yet this was a corruption of those sacred encounters, leaving a sense of violation in its wake.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] listened closely to the spirit, which repeatedly expressed a desire to be brought to 'my lady,' becoming increasingly agitated. I was intrigued, but sticking around did *not* seem like the right move, so we made our way topside once more.

Once above ground discussing our next move, [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] shared that a fiend had tried to grab [[Animal Companions/Obsidian\|Sid]], before he quickly summoned them back. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] was set on eliminating the fiend, but we realized that defeating it there would only be a temporary solution. What's worse, it seems that 'my lady' refers to [[Zariel\|Zariel]], a prominent figure in the [[blood war\|blood war]], with other unnamed archdevils potentially fitting this descriptor.

Our debate on whether to rest at the [[Businesses/Crimson Inn\|Crimson Inn]] or march forward was shrouded by the risk of the devil following us, possibly targeting us as 'quality' souls. The threat of deals and the conniving nature of devils lingered in our thoughts.

I shared what knowledge I gained from my circle’s the worship of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Dounuma\|Dumathoin]] — how some souls have destinations after death, sorted by [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/The Raven Queen\|The Raven Queen]] before possibly being sent to places like the [[Styx\|Styx]] if promised to a devil.

In the end, we chose not to risk any civilians’ safety by returning to the comfortable inn. Instead, we decided to hunt for [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]], hopefully aiding both [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]]'s quests in that way. Our path seemed to be leading us towards the [[Locations/Feywild/Autumn/Autumn\|Autumn]] Court, though how to get there wasn't immediately clear. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] suggested focusing on something specific about the area, like golden oak tree.

With concerted focus on golden oak and help from [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]], we navigated towards our elusive destination, passing through a mountainous landscape, eventually witnessing a clear sky filled with vibrant auroras, moons, stars, and even a constellation resembling a unicorn, subtly coming to life when unobserved.

Upon finding a cobblestone path by a stream, we stumbled upon a campsite and heard … arguing? [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] fearlessly went ahead to investigate and eventually led us to discover two sprites (pixies? nixies?). and a messenger bag with some items inside – including some expensive wine, apparently. The sprites advised us on who to watch out for and mentioned a village up the mountains ruled by [[Calisto\|Calisto]].

Choosing to camp by the river, the weight of [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]'s situation became more apparent — he feared that his use of magic was drawing him closer to death, and he did not hold back on emphasising that none of our attempts at offering a solution were insufficient to his mind. I admit that in some type of knee-jerk-like reflex, a part of me grew bitter at the thought of extending my help at all, but another part thought about my dealings with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets\|Da'yin Kuya]] and how deals *can* consist of a civil conversation and a balanced agreement, not a one-way ticket to demise.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] proposed to commune with her patron for guidance, offering to prioritize finding [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan]] due to their apparent dealings with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]]. Meanwhile, despite some semblance of exasperation nestling within me, I planned to commune with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets\|Da'yin]] yin later in hopes of finding a workable lead to solve [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]’s plight.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] and I first took the first watch for a frigid evening, however, readying ourselves for the long night ahead and the uncertainties that lay in wait. The fire has since gone out gone out and be rekindled. Now we wait for the hours to pass in temperatures not even my time in [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]] could have prepared me for.
