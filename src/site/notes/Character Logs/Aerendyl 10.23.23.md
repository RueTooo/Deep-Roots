*Session 3 log: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age*

The next room we wound up in, held four statues. I couldn't figure out of whom or how they related to each other, but it seemed fairly clear that we were to make a donation to the fountain in the centre, with the fox statue on top of it. It was full of coins and trinkets, so I added a silver piece to it.

Before long, another portal-like exit ( or entrance … ) opened up, pulsing with violet light. [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]] and myself stepped through first, followed by [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]].

It took us into a space darker than the backs of my eyelids, and I felt as though my heart was floating freely in my body. Whatever tension I held in anticipation swiftly vanished, and at that same point in time, three questions were posed — not aloud, but in the confines of my own mind:

- What do you seek?
- What will you do with this knowledge?
- Who are you?

I answered as honestly as I knew how to, and divulged I was looking for whatever lies at the end of this route through the tower to find its purpose; that I hoped this knowledge would further my venture to figure out what the dragon has been getting up to ( and why ), and that I am [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]], a druid, son to [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|the Stonecutter]] and [[Özge\|Özge]].

We all wound up in another room yet. Behind me, seemingly endless stairs led the way back up. The room itself held a statue of dragon on a basalt pedestal; no bigger than a wyrmling, with violet scales that refracted light, carved out of a single amethyst formation. Quite the stunning piece to look at!

According to [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]], dragons ( as far as he's aware ) don't have any particular ties to [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Hystaa\|Hystaa]] ( and I asked, as this is [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Hystaa\|Hystaa]]'s tower, after all ). They're known for their sense of justice, but other than that … nothing quite explicit.

In this same room, we also met up with [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus Quill]] at last. We exchanged introductions, and come across draconic script at the base of the pedestal on which the statue is situated. A riddle, apparently: *Enter and Wait, You Who Tempt Fate. Outlast or Outcast, Clever Hands Hold Fast*.

We all decided to take a rest before proceeding, and I thought no more of it. I instead took to decrypting more of [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|the Stonecutter]]'s journal. This time, I asked [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] to help me.

Her unique linguistic capabilities and general eye for patterns helped me reach new insights. She noted the sheets are about finding someone, or perhaps a group of people – tracking a story, or rumours, about someone? A thief; a betrayer. The Infernal script apparently has a thing or two to say on those who break their promises. It's powerful; almost like a curse. *Is [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|the Stonecutter]] the betrayer in this story*?

I'll have to find the answer another day (with [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]’s help, as she offered to teach me the language!), as we soon decided to head into the next room. There, we spot overlapping spiralling markings. Their light began pulsing, faster and faster, like something was counting down for us.

We all decided to wait until the light was barely flickering at all – then it brightened more still, while the room itself grew dimmer. The statue’s light behind us faded, and figures tall, lurching figures appeared atop the spirals. Their faces were like masks with too many eyes and rows of teeth. Their trinkets were reminiscent of those I saw in the fountain…

One of them reached towards [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]], and before long a fight ( of sorts ) broke out. My attention was tugged back to my past by the mere gaze of one of these creatures, when I lived happily at home with my parents.

Suddenly, everything in the world seemed fine. I was pulled through time, rushing through events. I was trying to find the figure that took my eye in exchange for its gift, and the amber eye that replaced it … I wound up dwelling on it, relaxing from this combat, suddenly, thinking of the triumph and transformation. The connection then broke, and I lurched back into the present.

I soon realised these were people, or entities, from the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]]; [[Secret keepers\|Secret keepers]].

They spawn and thrive in the deepest shadows of society, housing deception and obsession. The energy of that constant vigilance of all things social and the continuous nosing into all business can become strange, tangible aberrations. These aberrations keep searching for more to satiate their curiosity …

These [[Secret Keepers\|Secret Keepers]] are pure magic beings, feeding off the energy of those around. They’re easily influenced by the atmosphere in which they live. I warned [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] of this, but she paid it no heed. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] eventually pulled her out of one of the the [[Secret Keeper\|Secret Keeper]]’s reach.

A minute and then some, and the creatures fade along with the light. The room regains its former, arguably more natural lighting.

Before long, though, [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] stepped into one of the circles and the lights change again, reminiscent of the bright hues of the portal from my home to [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Rakāuvi\|Rakāuvi]]. [[Luca\|Luca]] incanted and woke the portal with some components at the time, almost coaxing it to bathe us in its light.

I snapped out of my reminiscence as the two [[Secret Keepers\|Secret Keepers]] showed up again. This is where I started thinking these bright, colourful circles might be portals, perhaps requiring a material component to be ‘gifted’, like the previous rooms did. Simultaneously, I wondered if these could be entryways into [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|the Feywilds]], or if they were one-directional …

But their distinct shade of violet must have reflected the school of conjuration, implying ( to my mind ) unidirectionality – in hindsight, at least.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]] try to speak to them in any language they know; anything with any roots in Fey tongues. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]]’ [[Languages/Sylvan\|Sylvan]] gets their attention, unsurprisingly. That was about as constructive as it got, because she soon started to attack them again.

I ran out of energy to heal her before long, and she fell. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Grunk the Mighty\|Grunk]] stabilised her, fortunately, but I can't help but wonder about the necessity of her chosen course of action. I simply don't see it.

I stepped forth to take her place in engaging with the [[Secret Keeper\|Secret Keeper]], in any case, after seeing [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] gift the other a piece of amethyst. I recall thinking that ‘*Clever Hands Hold Fast*’ might signify that the [[Secret Keeper\|Secret Keeper]], reaching out as it was, might simply have wanted its hand held. *Idiotic*. By the gods, don't know what came over me to think such a thing.

I can't remember what happened next. The first thing I **do** recall, is that the next moment, I was in agony. I was ( and **am** ) missing the first two knuckles of my left forefinger, its remaining stump bleeding and hurting. Somehow, I seem to at least have had the sense not to offer up my dominant hand.

The next thing I noticed, between the white-hot flashes of pain, is [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Lady Liatris\|Lady Liatris]], passed out on the floor, vanishing — or fading away, in some sense. She just disappeared. In my peripheral vision, I saw the dragon light up in a warm tone. Approval, perhaps?
