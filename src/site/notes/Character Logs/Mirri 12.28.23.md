22nd of Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.

Oh, ye gods. I don’t even know where to begin.

So much has happened in a single day! I haven’t had this much excitement in one solitary day since I was banned from that little town. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] and I arrived in the Archive that Halek spoke of and I got to work immediately. One of the workers? Sages? asked for research requests. I asked about him and tore through the information they have on him. He’s more notorious than I thought, but I didn’t really get a chance to dig into it deeper.

I met some *weirdos*. 

[[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] is half-elf, blonde and pretty; a warlock like myself, though his Patron is the stuff of nightmares—Zirel, the name I heard at the farm. The [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Thousand-Eyed Deceiver]]. And he is, of course, involved. Alas that we are entwined, my verbose friend. I only hope you survive it.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] is Genasi and he seemed to know [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|Malachi]]. They have the same gemstone eyes, or one of them, at least. The other is amber with a dark sclera. He’s TALL. He also dug himself into a hole and sat there for a minute after I described [[Entities/NPCs/Malachi\|Malachi]], so there has to be more to that tale. I’ll pursue it later. He seems sweet, though.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] is only a little older than me, a Shadar-Kai elf and a rogue. She’s stunning and it seems we have… similar tastes in facial tattoos. I think we’ll have quite a bit of fun together. Hopefully. She was overly nervous about the [[Terms and phrases/Pale Blight\|Pale Blight]]. Wonder what that’s about?

But, gods, there really is too much to write here. I took notes for half-a-dozen pages and I still can’t condense it all down. The 108th layer of the [[Locations/Abyss/Abyss\|Abyss]], heading into the [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|Feywild]], the [[Fallen Halls of Eristalon\|Fallen Halls of Eristalon]], Cabiri & other names for the… I’m going to call this demon-shit TED.

**He** was looking for something called the [[Items/Crown of the Faceless King\|Crown of the Faceless King]] about thirty years ago. That last wanted poster of him was dated to about that time.
I can’t stop thinking about it. Seeing his face again, even just on parchment. The eyes are still the same.

He looks older. I suppose I do as well.
