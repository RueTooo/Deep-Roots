? Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.
*Day 3 in the Feywilds*

We woke to one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. The second moon, [[Lucanthus\|Lucanthus]], was shining high in the sky and the snowfall was illuminated by a prismatic aurora from the moon… it was *incredible*. I could have stared at it for hours. I sometimes forget just how beautiful these places can be… how often have I become too focused on the hunting of **him** that I’ve missed the rest of the world around us? I wish I was a better artist so I could have captured it forever.

I have, however, captured the beautiful sculptures that greeted us, molded by the careful hand of [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]]: behold, the Snow-friends! We need a name for our weird little gang…

We’ve learned that the beautiful effect of the second moon is a Wild Magic Surge. Great. My fellow warlock sprouted a pair of gossamer dragonfly wings! I tested an [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Eldritch Blast\|Eldritch Blast]], but didn’t fully cast it, afraid of hitting something or someone out in the darkness.

I tried to cast [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Guidance\|Guidance]] as well, but it also failed. Great! I’m absolutely thrilled to be as useless as a [[Drow\|Drow]] in a desert, as [[Calimar\|Calimar]] used to say.

Gods, stop thinking about Cal, you thrice-damned fool. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Animal Companions/Obsidian\|Sid]] have gone down the Hole. I don’t know how long we’ll have to wait.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Animal Companions/Obsidian\|Sid]] have returned, I assume. We can hear the archaeologist’s voice, but we can’t see him. I’m assuming that his invisibility spell hasn’t worn off, yet another gift from Wild Magic. He says he **tasted** (???) some ***coagulated blood*** and described the layout of the Hole. We’re going in after [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]’s poachers. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] still hasn’t given much in terms of answers, but I’m hardly one to judge in that regard.

And speaking of [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]! They cast some sort of spell and sprouted ANTLERS. We hadn’t gotten far into a long crevice before the poachers noticed us. It wasn’t a long fight, or particularly difficult—one dwarf got away, but we’ll be following shortly. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] found 600 silver for each of us, 3,000 in total, and I’ve picked up some silver ink used with evocation spells, a decent pile of [[Blink Dog\|Blink Dog]] teeth and claws, and bark from a [[Dryad\|Dryad]]’s heart-tree which is the only salvageable part of this godsforsaken hole because I’VE GOT WINGS?? AND THE MAGIC FUCKED WITH MY HAIR!!
