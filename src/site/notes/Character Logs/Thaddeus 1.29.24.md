Personal Diary, Entry 46, 23rd? of Bloomwave, Year 515

It has been a few days since my last entry. Only days ago, I still knew next to nothing of the exact terms of my pact with my patron Zirel. Not that I know that much now. Since my last entry, keeping events brief, I have learned that Zirel is but one aspect of The Thousand Eyed Deceiver and they have taken on many different names as devil, demon, even celestial amongst many others. I learned that the sigil that I found was a method of summoning demons from the abyss, I fought demons. I never thought that would be a truthful statement, I don't think I wanted it to be.
My pact has put me in the rather unfortunate situation where I will either become a vessel for Zirel, for what I assume is just a fraction of The Thousand Eyed Deceiver, so that they may escape their prison. Or, to fail as Zirel's vessel and have the bonds that hold my body together dissolve.

In these few days we have also picked up new friends, Runa and Mirri. Mirri is a warlock as well, but the way they speak of their patron leaves me rather envious. Though if I had my way I'd be rid of the entire thing, and back to writing about the Mythrender society. 
For a number of reasons, we have decided the next leg of our journey takes us to the Feywilds. For myself, Mirri spoke of a Vestan Tlanbourn, someone who was communing with Zirel in a place called the Fallen Halls of Eristalon.

We entered the Winter court what may have been two days ago, I believe time here does not work the same as on Rakauvi, we may find we've been gone no time at all or several years longer once we return. Currently, we rest at a Remorhaz nest that was populated by poachers Runa had to deal with. We found a massive sigil of the king of hell, Asmodeus, as well as a candle and blood altar within the nest. We also found pixies, warped in a way that they almost seemed more like imps.

I verbalized a desire to speak with a devil while telling everyone what I knew about Asmodeus. In the moment it just felt like another method of information gathering, some way for me to learn how to break my pact. Devils are pretty well known for deal making after all. Corvaux however gave me a much needed reality check, I should not have spoken so flippantly about making deals with any devil, let alone Asmodeus. Though while I do understand it is wrong and shortsighted, I cannot stop thinking about what I read. One of Zirels potential vessels, seemingly having gone mad with their body terribly warped. Then they simply turned to dust.

I thought I had made peace with my mortality but it really is different when its staring you in the face. It may be wrong but, if making a deal with a devil meant getting to live, I can't say with absolute certainty anymore I would not take that deal. I often wonder lately if I have changed in any other ways. I still have not killed, a line I'm sure to cross eventually despite my own feelings about violence. In any case, it'd be nothing but foolish for me to try and reach out to a devil, once our rest is over and we are satisfied with what we find in the nest I would much rather just be done with the place.
