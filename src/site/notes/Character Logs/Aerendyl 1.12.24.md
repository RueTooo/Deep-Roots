*Session 13 Days 22 - 23 of Bloomwave, year 515 T.A*
Things got rowdy in the inn, as I let myself be roped into a chugging contest with [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]]. I lost, spectacularly, ending up unconscious and carried off to bed. I came to with a jolt and a nosebleed thanks to [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]]'s efforts to wake me up, and we got into a bit of a half-hearted argument. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] stuck by the entrance while [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] stepped out. Didn’t really see much of them afterwards until this morning, actually.

Unforeseen sidenote: a bit out of the blue, [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] kissed me, somewhere between calling me short and calling me ugly. I'm not sure where that came from or what to think about it. Will need to think on that when I can get a quiet moment to myself again. Or not. Maybe I should just forget it, and maybe I _will_.

Following ... that, she insisted we talk to the halflings performing on stage. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] came along ( or, rather, we just about begged her to, being the only one not completely preoccupied and sober, at that ). We bought the performers some drinks before getting into their story about bloody scenes in the snow and the destructive work of the poachers [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]]'s hunting. Somewhere along the way, we vowed to join them the next day as they head into the snow. We turned in for the night at length after that. 

This morning, I found the scar on my hand is healing better than expected, with a new, opalescent stone-like quality emerging from the regenerated skin. My wounds have never quite healed like that, so whether I should be concerned by this or not remains to be seen …

Upon reconvening with the others, [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]] informed me he obtained some new intel from [[Dex\|Dex]] about an entity called [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Orionis\|Orionis]], an [[archfey\|archfey]] that landed themself in hell, possibly linked to his patron [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]]. The specifics of [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]]’s intel are somewhat unclear to me – in fact, at this point, I’m only aware of half of what needs to be done by all my travelling companions –, but he allegedly needs to find the [[Free Sprites of Spring\|Free Sprites of Spring]], quite a while away from here.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]], meanwhile, seemed to have had a rough morning, looking outright distraught until she realized people were starting to wake up. She threw on a blanket and put on a happy front when greeting the rest of us. Seems like she's pushing through whatever's bothering her. ( Something to do with this *[[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Tlanbourn]]* she’s chasing? )

As it stands now, we’re set to make sense of the day ahead. We're prepping to face what might come in [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|the Feywilds]], combating poachers, learning about ominous entities, and handling unexpected personal developments — all while maintaining the ruse that we’re a family of some unhinged type.

Note to self: [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] are sisters in-law ( [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Varus]] married [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]]’s late brother ). [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] and I are newlyweds, or was it recent divorcees? And [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Ted]], well … apparently we just plucked him off the streets. I should probably circle back to this before we head out to make sure ...
