*Session 14*
Hopefully still Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.
*Day 2 in the Feywilds*

 We’ve left [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]]. I’m almost disappointed that we are leaving so soon, but the wilds beckon. And they are *cold.* The necklace [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] gave me keeps me plenty warm—I’ve used the Shiftweave to give the impression of winter gear without actually needing it.

 We traveled for a few hours, I assume, given that time works a bit strangely here. The landscape is entirely blanketed in snow… it’s beautiful, in a way I can’t quite describe, like… the antithesis of the Void. We stopped for a break & I asked [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] about his homeland. I know **he** was present at the university in [[Locations/Earth plane (elemental)/Sandfall City\|Sandfall City]], so regardless of what I find here, I’d like to know more. I **need** to know more.

 [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and I discussed our pacts & our souls. I wish I could help him, I wish I could tell him that this will get better, but I don’t know if it will. I don’t know. What is clear to me is just how… lucky I ended up. His pact and mine are so vastly different. My patron is perhaps the only true friend I have ever known and even that word, friend, is too ***small*** a word to encompass the truth of it. And the worst of it is that I cannot even begin to articulate how **my** pact came about because—

Ugh. I encouraged [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aerendyl]] to do something foolish to take their eyes off of me. His attempts to… “woo” [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]] were painful to witness, but they made for a fine distraction. I hope we can leave this place soon. I don’t like sticking to a story longer than a day or two.

We paused our hunt for [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]’s poachers to visit an icy shrine. Our guide fed some Redcaps with blood to keep them sated and I followed suit. I don’t have any plans on waking the dead. [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]], on the other hand, gave a very impassioned speech about what he might learn of lost civilizations if he had the option to rouse the dead. He also wants an interview with a Redcap and a Revenant if he can find them.

 [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] is a gift wrapped in silver ribbons for someone like ***him.***

That is what worries me the most.

We’ve found a ***big*** hole. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Runa]]’s poachers are probably waiting at the bottom for the monster that has made its nest there. We’ve set up camp to wait for these poachers to return. I’m not sure what we’ll do with them—our taciturn half-orc companion hasn’t said much about what their goals are here… but I cannot fault them in that regard. You keep some things close to the chest for a reason.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and I will swap out on watch. I’m first. I wish I could *sleep*. I want to talk to [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow\|Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow]]. I want the comfort of the Void.
