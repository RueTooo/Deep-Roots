*[Session 7] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Alongside* 

We didn't quite get around to figuring out was on the murals. All I managed to glean from the panel with the Terran [[Languages/Primordial\|Primordial]] script ( with [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]]’ assistance ) was that it described the temperaments of different stones, and the potential repercussions of imbuing them with power – or *life*, even. It seemed the dragon-esque statue in the centre of the room might've been meant as the object of an experiment involving giving life to stone ..? 

I hope we can come back to figure it out, alongside the contents of the other panels, because before I knew it, ever enthusiastic [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] set off and we all felt compelled to follow suit. We wound up in a hallway below, where we found [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Professor Ssimmia Hakani\|Professor Hakani]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Eldanor Nightbloom\|Eldanor Nightbloom]].

We found some weird things here. Stone that seemed to cling to life, a few doors … I myself was instantly drawn to the first on the left side, recognising the symbolism of the half-cut diamond as belonging to [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Dounuma\|Dumathoin]] ( or [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Dounuma\|Dounuma]], if you prefer ). Not too surprising, then, that I wound up in a very neatly-kept … crypt of sorts, after opening it.

The scent of incense, quite like the type used in elven funerals, hung suspended in the air, and a large window afforded a view of massive amethyst formations outside, framed by utter darkness.

The room itself contained four sarcophagi, each adorned with different symbols and decorations. A discussion with [[Entities/NPCs/Dig Team/Professor Ssimmia Hakani\|Professor Hakani]] has me wondering if these might be disciples of four of the five great dragons – excluding [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Aesa\|Aesa]], as some of her most ‘advanced’ followers do not die, per se; not as we know it. They transcend this way of living and may not die at all in this plane.

After a while of pondering and swapping ideas with the professor, I hear voices coming through another door in the chamber. I proceed through it, and find [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] chatting with a stranger in a laboratory of sorts, accompanied by another dragon-like creature.

The stranger, named [[Xilo\|Xilo]], mentions the four buried in the previous chamber are ‘the ones that came with the books’. What books? Why? I couldn't tell you, dear reader. I'll have to ask later and document what I learn.

We all conversed a bit – though I took on more of a listening role than anything else. [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] handed over the paper that fell from the building the dragon carried overhead before we set off into [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Baheera\|Baheera]], and apparently this was part of some long-lost book; Xilo also mentioned something about the [[Firmament\|Firmament]] ( disciples of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Gereth\|Gereth]] ), and then the conversation veered towards a blood sigil [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] found.

When the two set off in its direction again, I followed along — not expecting to be of much help, really, but you never know, right? Too bad [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] wound up figuring out something's already made use of that sigil and weaselled its way into the room, and invisibly so at that.

And what an ugly ( and powerful ) demonic bastard that turned out to be … *a quick scribble of two blades crossing to signify the fight that broke out closes off that sentence – like ⚔️ *
