*Session log for Aeren's 2nd session, with @zaqurie's Bell :sparkles:* 

Today was not the quiet trek towards the tower I had expected. Fortunately, I encountered a stranger during the last leg of the hike, just a stone's throw from the tower the Stonecarver described in his diary. They were rather better dressed for the cold than I was — but I had Vigil's pendant to keep me warm along the way.

We chose to venture on together – and as I write this, it occurs to me that I never even got his name … how foolish of me – just as the onset of a blizzard began to engulf the slope in snow, and us along with it.

I briefly investigated the altar in front of the tower, having read that, despite its incredibly narrow construction, people *have* entered it, as well as the seven other visible towers along this mountain range. Allegedly, entering them and completing the trials within would grant access to a ninth, otherwise invisible tower … Either way, I found no instant way of opening any doors, though; only a clawed hand print of sorts and a sigil – with dwarvish runes – on the ground. Arcana never was my strong suit.

After briefly lamenting the fact I could not more thoroughly investigate this tower so similar to Sunnis’ back in Sandfall, my newfound companion and I ventured on and up the mountain. There, we found the entrance to a cavern of sorts.

The stranger seemed unsettled by it, but it was certain death under a thick blanket of snow, or braving the *possibility* of it in this game. We chose the latter.

Inside, we found two cultists – at least, I think they were. We observed quietly from a height along a ledge as they performed their ritual about a large sigil on the cavern floor, decorated with Draconic sigils. Fitting, then, that they later also spoke Draconic to each other. I also noticed a stone door of sorts on the wall directly below the drop.

My companion and I before long decided on a two-pronged approach to figure out what was happening. I tried distracting them – clumsily – with conversation, while my companion circled around the other side.

He, however, decided to end my evident uncertainty and propel things onwards by somehow conjuring a massive iron door, and dropping it on them. Needless to say, they were unhappy with us for that. I'll spare myself the ink by stating we overpowered the two as they attempted to complete the ritual hastily.

We found a league of items on their bodies. One of them held a light crossbow + 20 bolts, light leather armour, a scimitar, dagger ( silver filigree-covered , both blade and hilt ), the scrap of paper he’d been clinging to – with an alphabet I don’t understand –, a rough sort of circle with notes indicating different parts of the sigil on the floor. Also a half dozen empty vials, a dark brown stain in them; like they once contained blood.

The other held similar items, except his dagger was obsidian. We unmasked the cultists, one of them a high-elf, and the other a dwarf. On the latter, we found remnants of a tattoo below his neck, between the shoulder blades. It was a circular pattern with curved, jagged lines, reminiscent of a sun with an empty centre, or a whirlpool of sorts. Perhaps it was even a directional guide of sorts?

We examined the door as well, but I can’t read the writing on it, nor could I open it. However, after contemplating for a while as we rested, I am almost certain the writing is also draconic. Shrines in the temple in Sandfall displayed this script, and these were dedicated to (allegedly) one of the first dragons to ever exist.

My companion and I parted ways as the storm died down, and he was kind enough to gift me some gold for the road ahead.

So, in short, it seems we stumbled upon a dragon-worshipping cult of sorts. I’m not entirely sure how this ties in to the eight ( or nine, I suppose ) towers, if it at all. Maybe I’m imagining things, but it all seems too odd to be a mere coincidence. I’ll have to think on the matter a while longer …
