**Day 25-26 of Bloomweave, year 515 T.A.?**
In the presumed safety of our cave, we exchanged names, real and fake, amidst the tension lingering from prior events with the pixies. I felt uneasy, my nerves frazzled, a sensation that muted my voice more than I'd like to admit.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]], whom we'd come to know as [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Luck of the Draw]], admitted once more he had lost count of his time in this place. Having been a merchant back in [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari]], exile to [[Locations/Feywild/Feywild\|the Feywilds]] seemed to have stretched long for him. Yet our conversation took turns; he even bested me at arm wrestling — which cost me five gold in the friendly wager.

Our dialogue ventured deeper — [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]]'s devotion to the [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/The Raven Queen\|Raven Queen]] lay in the medium of memories, a practice carrying more weight with each recounted past. [[Ambassador Ushan\|Ambassador Ushan]]'s mention brought speculation on the years that had folded since [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]] had last walked among the [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari\|Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Sylvari/Sylvari]] (300 at worst, apparently?!).

Arguably of more interest to myself, though, [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]] is headed for the [[Silver Maple\|Silver Maple]]. He even confirmed his task as such must be to deal with the source of the [[Terms and phrases/Pale Blight\|Pale Blight]], alongside various others sent out to what may well be certain death.

On first watch with [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]], the comfort of the comparatively temperate cold and a secure cave eased the watchful hours. The sky's nocturnal ballet showcased [[Lucanthis\|Lucanthis]] in its viridescence, a calming contrast to the previous night's capricious display. The occasional sound from outside drew our attention—a branch snapping, a tree falling—but nothing came of it.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]]'s tale of being ensnared by the pixies in their displeasure painted the forest as an unforgiving loop of traps and deceit. His warning of a potential curse prompted a check of my rations — indeed, I was down to one. In an act of providence, [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]] went out to forage, and returned with an unexpected feast of bounty.

Dawn brought chaos as we clashed with the elusive dwarf that vanished into the pack during our encounter with the poachers. Her fate was bloodily sealed at the end of the skirmish. The issue of the pack persisted, though; [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]]'s desire to delve into it weighed against [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Mirabelle]]'s insistence on understanding the hunter's narrative.

[[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]]'s intent on entering the pack led to a collective decision; ensuring its security demanded creativity. The choice to pursue an animal guardian fell to [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]], who returned with an almiraj named [[Phlip\|Phlip]], while I closed the entrance to the cave after patching up [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] (likewise alongside [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]]). 

We were prepared to enter whatever lay in the pack stealthily. [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]], in her guise as a fallen enemy, led us in — upon which all of us, save for [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]], were caged upon entering. Her quest for tokens to authorise our release sent her away, leaving us encased and uncertain.

The prison's bars were eerily reminiscent of the cold iron found in the [[Bitter Steppes\|Bitter Steppes]] at home, including their anti-magical properties. All we could do as such was wait in lieu of risking a botched attempt at escaping and triggering more alarms ( or worse ), until [[Entities/Player Characters/Runa\|Anur]] returned with the means to unshackle us: tokens bearing [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]]' seal, striking deeper questions about our actual location.

My best guess to this point is that we're in a demi-plane of some sort. I suspected the [[Locations/Abyss/Abyss\|Abyss]] for a moment, but the sigil anchoring the portal in place simply didn't seem to suggest it. All the same time, knowing the symbol on this seal has everything to do with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]], *still* raises questions. This place is called “[[Dain's Prison\|Dain's Prison]]” – and by virtue of our last talk with Ted, I recall [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Glasya\|Glasya]], [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]]’ daughter, rules the prison plane of the hells ([[Locations/Hell/Malbolge\|Malbolge]]). What if this “[[Dain's Prison\|Dain's Prison]]” is somehow connected to it? Related to it? It is the only way in which the symbols on these tokens make any sense to me.

Ah, I digress. We ventured further after a moment, down the stairs, and were greeted by braziers that seemed to conceal more prisons. Lining the walls, tables held both scholarly scrolls and unsettling dissection instruments. Amidst a cold emanating glow, [[Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\|Jorinn]]'s and my attempt to obtain a shard from a peculiar crystal teetered between curiosity and caution—the material's fragility and volatility reminiscent of volatile cold iron.

The others already ventured farther down the stairs. Time to follow suit, rather than risk blowing up this place for the sake of a sliver of that cold, glowing crystal …
