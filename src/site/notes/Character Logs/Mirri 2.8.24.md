*End of Day 3 in the Feywilds*

We left the hole rather suddenly. It was for the absolute best, of course, considering the harrowing details given to the group by [[Entities/Player Characters/Corvaux\|Corvaux]] and [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]]. After a tense discussion of what our next steps are, we have decided to head to [[Locations/Feywild/Autumn/Autumn\|Autumn]], to the [[Fallen Halls\|Fallen Halls]]. To **him.**

To say I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of it is an understatement. It’s one thing to see his likeness sketched, to see wanted posters that show me that he has grown older, thinner. It is another thing entirely to face him again. I want nothing more than to put him in the ground. I want nothing more than to understand, at long last, why he has done any of this in the first place.

We left the hole, its ghosts, & its devils behind, hopefully. Along the path, we encountered two pixies, one in hysterics over what ended up being a simple abandoned pack. The other was quite fascinated with my hair, much to my anguish. I can’t wait for it to be back to normal, to run a proper brush through it again. Damn wild magic.

As we decided to set up camp here on the mountainside and continue on to a nearby village in the morning (?) [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] said he wished to talk.
I gathered what I’d need to clean up after I commune with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow]] first. I’m used to the aftermath, but my companions are not, so it’s best to be prepared ahead of time.

*Surprisingly mild swearing in [[Languages/Abyssal\|Abyssal]] is scrawled across the page*

> you bastard idiot pointed-ear little fucker

How can one so smart as [[Entities/Player Characters/Retired/Thaddeus Quill\|Thaddeus]] be so fucking stupid?!?

I’m on my third cup of tea because that godsdamned bottle we found in the pack is too expensive to waste, but—How can he even CONSIDER calling upon a devil to break his Pact? As if a deal with a devil will somehow be better?? As if [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]] will not **know,** will not **punish** such a foolish action??

Any plea for patience, for one godsdamned night to let me ASK [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Hallow]] what they know fell on increasingly deaf ears. Gods, I could strangle him with his own shawl for it. And what if he does it? If Thaddeus does call on [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Devils/Asmodeus\|Asmodeus]] or any other archdevil of the Hells, what then? What other sacrifices will be demanded to rescue an academic from yet another bad Pact?

~~It’s How~~

**He** started as an academic, too.
