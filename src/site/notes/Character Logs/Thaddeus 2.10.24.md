Personal Diary, Entry 48, The date doesn't particularly matter. 

After twisting the ring gifted to me by [[Entities/NPCs/Epiphany\|Epiphany]] I had little to say to them before choosing to sign the contract. Only that I wanted, in writing, conformation that I and only I will be responsible for the collection of three beautiful souls as described in my contract. Upon my death or otherwise have an inability to complete the contract, it will simply remain incomplete. The devils aren't to involve any of my associates, friends, or family to complete the contract in my stead.

Then I signed it. I only wish I could've told my now ex-party not to bother searching for solutions on my behalf, but until now I couldn't speak of my contract and as such had no reason to give them not to even try. I wonder if the attempt was truly for my benefit, or just to foil the plans of a fiend. I don't pretend to believe I am making a morally right decision here, but I have few and fewer options that I am brave enough to follow through on. At least now I'll know how many people must die in my presence before my journey is over. Hells, that number can even be zero with this contract.

If things get more complicated, if there ends up being even further steps to my freedom after this contract, I'm going home. I'm going to hug my father, finish my thesis, publish my findings, then I'm buying a vial of strong poison and finding somewhere nice to look out towards. My body, my mind, and my soul will never be the playthings of higher powers.

As stated, I have been separated from my party. Partially, perhaps mostly by choice. But also as I had predicted my choice to deal with devils was largely unacceptable to the party. Many words were shared, many threats as well. Most hurtful were [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Entities/Player Characters/Mirri]]'s, to compare me to a vile man whom I have only had glimpses into their evil nature. I am not willing to do anything and everything to free myself of this pact or to complete any of my other goals. My character, my morality has been chipped away on my year long journey, people have already died in my presence with shocking glee or ferocity from my compatriots. Worse still when they seemed to not even regard that they have killed. How much more of myself would have been sacrificed if I continued this path? How long until I took lives with just as little thought? 

No, I refuse to go that far. Three souls, I need not even kill them but regardless of how they are collected I will never forget the three I have chosen. Even if others choose to forgive me, I will ensure I never forgive myself for it. I refuse to allow such actions to be done without thought, without regret. And should a single thing more be asked of me, I shall refuse and return home. It has to end somewhere and I will be the one making that choice. 

I'm returning to town, I need to gather my mind and decide the next steps of my journey.
