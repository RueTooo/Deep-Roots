## Description
Taking its name from the ancient elvish word "Halinhyr," which means "Sacred Grove," Hallowhymn is an island continent of intense wild magic. Tales tell of the trees here emitting melodious and haunting tunes, some say they sway in an ethereal dance, captivating any who dare disrespect the law of the wood elves who call this island home. Most villages and cities on the Hallowhym islands are accessible only by climbing or swimming.
