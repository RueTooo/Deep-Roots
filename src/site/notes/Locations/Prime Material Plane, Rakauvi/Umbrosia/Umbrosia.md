## Description
Umbrosia is the land of the mythical Tree of Shadows, a place even devils and demons fear. This continent, shrouded in perpetual darkness, is home to strange bioluminescent flora and fauna. The twisted trees in Umbrosia seem to bend and morph with the shifting shadows, giving the whole land an eerie and mystical atmosphere. Magic behaves oddly here, making Umbrosia a destination for many mages and curious researchers, many of whom build towers or outposts to conduct their experiments.
