## Description
A haunted continent dominated by the sprawling Yewwood Forest, cloaked in a literal layer of magic. Centuries ago an order of mages sealed this continent off, in order to halt the advance of the corruption that grew and spread from the heart of the forest. It is unknown who or what still survives within these magical walls, though rumors circulate now and then of the vast wealth one can find there, if they only dare enter.
