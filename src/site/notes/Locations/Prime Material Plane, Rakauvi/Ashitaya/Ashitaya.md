## Description
[[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Ashitaya/Ashitaya\|Ashitaya]], derived from an old halfling dialect, translates to "Eternal Oak." This continent is home to an enormous and ancient oak tree that serves as the heart and soul of the land, its acorns are said to possess incredible healing properties and are sought after by many. There are no cities or towns here, as the people shun organized society, so those who seek the blessed acorns must venture in themselves - or pay massive prices of those bold enough to enter the forest. Here, the god of the First Oak walks among the people, his footsteps like thunder.
