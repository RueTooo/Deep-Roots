## Description
The sun-drenched continent of Baheera looks like a perfect paradise of sand dunes and lush rainforests. The name Baheera means "Oasis of Life" in the orcish language, and many people here live nomadic lifestyles, herding magnificent beasts said to carry small villages on their backs. Deep in the center of the largest desert one can find a massive plateau where a great Djinn lives, their home hidden in a perpetual sandstorm.
