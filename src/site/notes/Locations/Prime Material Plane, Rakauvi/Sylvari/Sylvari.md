## Description
The enchanting continent of Sylvari, where the lush and verdant Maple Grove blankets the land. It is said that every stem and leaf harnesses the potent magic flowing through the ancient Elderroot, a colossal maple tree said to be the first of its kind. Here, one finds picturesque farms and pastures, ruled by a council of nobles. Sylvari boasts of magnificent cities, opulent entertainment, and bazaars with goods from every continent. A majority of Rakauvi's population lives here in Sylvari.
