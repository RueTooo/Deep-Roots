## Description
Obsidian Range - a sort of Feywild equivalent to the [[Underdark\|Underdark]], with deep reaching chasms and even some passages that lead to [[Locations/Shadowfel/Shadowfel\|Shadowfel]], if you survive the passage. There are unique creatures, bizarre weather events (think massive ethereal jellyfish rising out of the ground, floating up), 

Life without the sun moves at a different pace than the surface. Crisscrossing through the Court are two massive forces of nature - the [[Amarudi Magma River\|Amarudi Magma River]] and the [[Bexwali Sea\|Bexwali Sea]] - and where the two meet, one can find a remarkable amphibious enclave called the [[Torn Jade Reef\|Torn Jade Reef]].
