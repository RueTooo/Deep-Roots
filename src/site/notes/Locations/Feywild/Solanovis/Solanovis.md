## Description
A collection of floating islands. Created after the [[Spellplague\|Spellplague]], it's the newest of the courts. 

The [[Locations/Feywild/Solanovis/Solanovis\|Sky Ward]] broke away from a high reaching mountain many eons ago, during a time of great upheaval in the fey realm. Now, flying above the clouds are dozens of cities, gardens, and more. Accessible only by flight (or very rare geological conditions), many giantkin and races gifted with flight live here. Climb high enough in the sky on the back of a wyvern or rok, you could even reach the shores of the Astral Sea. The Court is ruled by a trio of elected representatives, and the archfey are remarkably beautiful - many wonder if there are celestials among them. This is the smallest court in the realm, and they very rarely send emissaries to other courts or planes. Astral elves as well as autognomes, warforged, gith and kalashtar can be found here.
