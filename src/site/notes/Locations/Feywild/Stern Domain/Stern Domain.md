## Description
Surrounding the Seasons Continent is the Stern Domain. It is a raging everstorm that can only be navigated by the most skilled crews and ships. But if you can find your way through the maelstroms and jagged coral ridges (not to mention the incredible wildlife), the reward is phenomenal: amphibious communities with incredible culture that touch the elemental planes of Water, Air, Lighting, and Thunder - though only when the conditions are right. Their proximity to these planes gives them access to power and resources unavailable in the rest of the realm. 

As secretive and private as Winter is, those in the Stern Domain are even more difficult to get to know. They are not charitable to foolish sailors who try to navigate the everstorm to reach their shores uninvited.
