## Description
Summer is the most technologically advanced of any of the seasons, developing steam power, airships, and more. Most of the arable land is taken up with farming, and Summer grows the bulk of the grains eaten across the entire plane. Slinking through the whole Season is a massive chain of mountains which is said to shimmer like the scales of the Platinum Dragon himself at sunrise and sunset. 
Summer boasts of a magnificent airship fleet, the most advanced of the Season's Courts. Summer is also famous for having learned to work with rare and unusual materials, utilizing dangerous substances like cold iron, quicksilver, and even lightning itself. The Quellwrights who handle these deadly materials are both feared and respected for their knowledge and skill.
