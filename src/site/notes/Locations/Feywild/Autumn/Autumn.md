## Description
Autumn is the Court of Forests. Some of the oldest records in the universe can be found in the dryads' libraries. Scholars from across the realms come here to study and learn, and many study their whole life without leaving again. Autumn has the deepest connections to beasts and fauna - many have remarkable control over druidic wildshaping skills. Some Autumn courtiers live their entire life in the cities at the center of each archfey's forest, never once walking upon the ground itself. In some places, the trees reach up past the clouds, and it is said that if you climb high enough, you will find giants living in stone clouds that levitate miles above the ground. 
Each forest has a certain amount of autonomy, but all are united in their deep roots and ancient histories. Autumn may lack in military strength or technological advances, but the knowledge and texts curated by the archfey are priceless.
