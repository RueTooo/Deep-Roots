Ash - **[[Entities/Titans/Autumn Court/Archfey/Samara\|Samara]]**: hardy wood used to craft weapon and tool handles (spears, hammers, shovels). Culturally rough, currently not a court favorite 
Baobab - **[[Entities/Titans/Autumn Court/Archfey/Adansonia\|Adansonia]]**: second oldest dryad in Autumn, their forest is the agricultural center of Autumn. Baobab seeds, leaves, and fruit are all edible. Currently the leader of the court
Birch - **[[Entities/Titans/Autumn Court/Archfey/Fitzroya\|Fitzroya]]**: Now the trainer/leader of the Autumn Authority, attempts to restore the previous prestige and glory of Autumn before the fall. 
Cypress - **[[Entities/Titans/Autumn Court/Archfey/Thuja\|Thuja]]**: major port of Autumn now that Spruce and Oak are gone. Wood from this forest is rot-resistant, the courtiers are corruption-free (or as much as any society can be). 
Sequoia - **[[Entities/Titans/Autumn Court/Archfey/Calyptica\|Calyptica]]**: former leader of the court, Calyptica is devoted now to forest restoration and stewardship. Her forest is very small, having lost much of her territory to flooding. 

After the fall of Great Oak ([[Entities/Titans/Eristalon\|Aurelius]]), the court also lost Maple ([[Kelsea\|Kelsea]]) and Spruce ([[Tjikko\|Tjikko]]) who chose to accept Winter's invitation to join their court. 
[[Entities/Titans/Autumn Court/Archfey/Fitzroya\|Fitzroya]] is the leader of the five dryad archfey, her forest is located in the geographic center of Autumn.
