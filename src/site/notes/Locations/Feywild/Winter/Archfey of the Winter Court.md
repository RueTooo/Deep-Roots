**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Ithliyian\|Ithliyian]]** personifies compassion and hospitality, embodying the most generous side of the elemental forces that define the transition between the bitter cold and the hopeful dawn. They dwell in the [[Ghastalphan Mountains\|Ghastalphan Mountains]], a natural and magical border between the Winter and Spring courts.

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Umibuki\|Umibuki]]** is the [[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Umibuki\|Rootmother]], a serene Archfey who keeps on good terms with **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]**, keeping the deep cold from freezing the forests of Winter. To her, all in the [[Underfey\|Underfey]] give thanks, as her mighty roots hold up the grey sky (the roofs of vast subterranean caverns) where most of Winter's population resides. 

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Shirosa\|Shirosa]]** is the [[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Shirosa\|Roaring Wind]], is an Archfey of enormous power who dwells in the thickest blizzards and harshest winds. It is wise to beg her favor before travelling across open ground. There are days her fury runs so deep that only **[[Ithiliyan\|Ithiliyan]]** can calm her. 

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]** and **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]** are twin dragons who are Archfey of the first snow ([[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]) and the first melt ([[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]) of Winter - both the Seasonal Court and the seasonal passage of time. 
- On the last day of autumn, when the [[Masking Days\|Masking Days]] begin, **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]** travels away from Winter, bringing the first snowflakes of the year. Where snow cannot fall, he sends other signs of winter's arrival. 
- **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]** arrives as a sign that the deep cold has passed - that the bitterest temperatures are behind us, and that spring is not far off. Her arrival begins the first melt, as glacial streams and [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]]'s fiery maw send columns of steam up into the air, all the way to [[Locations/Feywild/Solanovis/Solanovis\|Solanovis]].

These five Archfey are intrinsically linked to the land and the weave that flows the Winter. In front of **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]]** and **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]]** they may quarrel amongst themselves at times, but all serve their twin rulers with complete adoration and unwavering loyalty. With the twin monarchs' leadership, balance is maintained despite the chaos of these primal forces.
