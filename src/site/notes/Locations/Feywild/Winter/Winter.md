## Description
Winter is a sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps. 
Much of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to both elementals and beastfolk. 


The people of Winter are, by and large, very private. Many Winter communities are hidden, with secret methods or whispered codes used to reveal the entrance. The people can be equally difficult to get to know, though once a bond of trust is formed, many in Winter will honor that bond even beyond death.

These five Archfey are intrinsically linked to the land and the weave that flows the Winter. In front of **[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]]** and **[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]]** they may quarrel amongst themselves at times, but all serve their twin rulers with complete adoration and unwavering loyalty. With the twin monarchs' leadership, balance is maintained despite the chaos of these primal forces.

## History
When the [[Chrysalis Queen\|Chrysalis Queen]] and the [[Shadow King\|Shadow King]] vanished in the [[Lore/Spellplague\|Spellplague]], the Court was thrown into chaos. In the midst of the upheaval, many strong clans and cities took advantage, and used the rulers' absence as a chance to grab land from other seasons. 
The mysterious twins [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]] rose as strong voices, and united Winter to lead them in defense of the realm when devils of [[Baator\|Baator]] broke through during the Spellplague.
