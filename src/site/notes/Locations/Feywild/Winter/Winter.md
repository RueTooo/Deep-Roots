## Description
Winter is a sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps. 
Much of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to both elementals and beastfolk. 


The people of Winter are, by and large, very private. Many Winter communities are hidden, with secret methods or whispered codes used to reveal the entrance. The people can be equally difficult to get to know, though once a bond of trust is formed, many in Winter will honor that bond even beyond death.

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Ithliyian\|Ithliyian]]** personifies compassion and hospitality, embodying the most generous side of the elemental forces that define the transition between the bitter cold and the hopeful dawn. They dwell in the [[Ghastalphan Mountains\|Ghastalphan Mountains]], a natural and magical border between the Winter and Spring courts.

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Umibuki\|Umibuki]]** is the [[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Umibuki\|Rootmother]], a serene Archfey who keeps on good terms with **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]**, keeping the deep cold from freezing the forests of Winter. To her, all in the [[Underfey\|Underfey]] give thanks, as her mighty roots hold up the grey sky (the roofs of vast subterranean caverns) where most of Winter's population resides. 

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Shirosa\|Shirosa]]** is the [[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Shirosa\|Roaring Wind]], is an Archfey of enormous power who dwells in the thickest blizzards and harshest winds. It is wise to beg her favor before travelling across open ground. There are days her fury runs so deep that only **[[Ithiliyan\|Ithiliyan]]** can calm her. 

**[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]** and **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]** are twin dragons who are Archfey of the first snow ([[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]) and the first melt ([[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]) of Winter - both the Seasonal Court and the seasonal passage of time. 
- On the last day of autumn, when the [[Masking Days\|Masking Days]] begin, **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]** travels away from Winter, bringing the first snowflakes of the year. Where snow cannot fall, he sends other signs of winter's arrival. 
- **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]** arrives as a sign that the deep cold has passed - that the bitterest temperatures are behind us, and that spring is not far off. Her arrival begins the first melt, as glacial streams and [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]]'s fiery maw send columns of steam up into the air, all the way to [[Locations/Feywild/Solanovis/Solanovis\|Solanovis]].

These five Archfey are intrinsically linked to the land and the weave that flows the Winter. In front of **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]]** and **[[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]]** they may quarrel amongst themselves at times, but all serve their twin rulers with complete adoration and unwavering loyalty. With the twin monarchs' leadership, balance is maintained despite the chaos of these primal forces.

## History
When the [[Chrysalis Queen\|Chrysalis Queen]] and the [[Shadow King\|Shadow King]] vanished in the [[Spellplague\|Spellplague]], the Court was thrown into chaos. In the midst of the upheaval, many strong clans and cities took advantage, and used the rulers' absence as a chance to grab land from other seasons. 
The mysterious twins [[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]] and [[Entities/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]] rose as strong voices, and united Winter to lead them in defense of the realm when devils of [[Baator\|Baator]] broke through during the Spellplague.
