###### In the days before time, there were five dragon spirits who ruled over the elements. 
[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Carragon\|Carragon]], [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Pyra\|Pyra]], [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Gereth\|Gereth]], [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Nexeus\|Nexeus]], and [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Aesa\|Aesa]] were their names, and each was master of their respective domain. They were mighty and powerful, and their pride was great, for they believed themselves to be the most important of all.

One fateful day, the dragons' pride erupted into a great and terrible battle. The earth shook with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Carragon\|Carragon]]'s stomping, flames engulfed the sky with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Pyra\|Pyra]]'s wrath, [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Gereth\|Gereth]] whipped up fierce winds and storms, [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Nexeus\|Nexeus]] flooded the land, and [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Aesa\|Aesa]] disappeared into the ether. 

The battle raged on for centuries, until the dragons grew weary of their endless conflict.
It was then that the five dragon deities came together to create new races that would embody their abilities, to live and explore the new land they had created with their battle. [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Carragon\|Carragon]] breathed upon the earth, and from it emerged the **lizardfolk**, tough and sturdy creatures that would be tied to the earth and all its creatures. [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Pyra\|Pyra]]'s flames transformed the **kobolds**, quick-witted and cunning creatures that would be blessed and cursed with creativity. [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Gereth\|Gereth]]'s winds imbued the **dragonborn** with power and chaos, connecting them to their breath weapons. [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Nexeus\|Nexeus]]'s waters gave rise to the **tortles**, resilient and wise creatures that would be connected to oceans across worlds. Finally, [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Dragon Spirits/Aesa\|Aesa]]'s mysterious spirit gave rise to the **Yuan Ti**, creatures of great intelligence and insight, connected to the Astral realm.
The five dragon deities looked upon their creations with great satisfaction.
