## Description
Mirri is a con artist and a charlatan, developing alternative identities as it becomes useful to her. She has been chasing [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]] for 54 years, seeking justice after the death of her brother [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]].
### Early Life
Prior to Mirri's birth, her father [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]] attempted to gain power by promising his firstborn to an entity in the [[Locations/Abyss/Wells of Darkness\|Wells of Darkness]]. He believed he was communing with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\|Zirel]], but instead he contacted [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Hallow]], the servant to [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Pantheon/Faen\|Faen]] who was also trapped in the [[Locations/Abyss/Wells of Darkness\|Wells of Darkness]], having been captured by [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Demons/Orchus\|Orchus]]. 

### Significant Events
Years later, when [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]] failed to develop the power he expected, he sent for his child, who he reasoned must have received it instead. 
Through miscommunication or bad luck, [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Entities/Player Characters/Mirri]]'s half brother [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]] was captured by [[Entities/NPCs/Vestan Tlanbourn\|Vestan Tlanbourn]]'s men. Having never met either, Vestan sacrificed [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]] in a ritual meant to harvest his powers. [[Entities/Player Characters/Mirri\|Entities/Player Characters/Mirri]] interrupted the ritual and carried [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]] away, running for hours, before eventually realizing that her brother had died in her arms. 
When Mirri returned home with [[Entities/NPCs/Paelias\|Paelias]]'s body, she was exiled by her mother, who believed she was involved with his death. 
### Important Relationships
Mirri's connection with [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Hallow]] is an enigmatic one. Their communication is largely indirect, confined to emotions while Mirri is conscious. When she sleeps, however, they speak telepathically in what appears to be an inky void. 
In their first direct conversation, she learned that [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Hallow]] had not sought out their link, but rather had gravitated on instinct toward what she perceived to be the sole light in the [[Locations/Abyss/Abyss\|Abyss]]. Although apologetic to Mirri, acknowledging that the elf had not consented to the connection that leaves physical traces on Mirri as it grows, Mirri acts as [[Dnd Resources/Spells/PHB spells/Hallow\|Hallow]]'s only tether to hope while she exists in the [[Locations/Abyss/Abyss\|Abyss]], a link [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Hallow\|Hallow]] would not choose to sever.
## Peculiarities
Mirri is being followed by an "invisible stalker." Several times in the past fifty years, there have been unexplained winds caused by some unseen force.
