<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



[[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aeren]] visited [[Entities/Titans/Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets\|Da'yin]] to trans his gender. In exchange, Aeren traded one of his eyes for an astral agate eye from Da'yin. When Aeren wanted to know what the genie does with the eyes, she agreed to tell him, but not for free. 
With these eyes, Da'yin (and other powerful beings) can catch glimpses of the present, gaining insight into possible futures. As payment for this information, [[Entities/Player Characters/Aerendyl\|Aeren]] promised to, at some point in the future when Da'yin requires it, give her his time and aid.
