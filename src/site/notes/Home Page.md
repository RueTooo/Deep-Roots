Winter is a sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps. When the Chrysalis Queen and the Shadow King vanished at the beginning of the Third Age, the Court was thrown into chaos. In the midst of the upheaval, many strong clans and leaders took advantage, and used the rulers' absence as a chance to grab land from other seasons until the mysterious twins [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]] rose as strong voices, and united the Season to lead them in defense of the realm. Much of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to primal forces - both elemental and beastlike. 

The people of Winter are by and large very private. Many Winter communities are hidden, with secret methods or whispered codes used to reveal the entrance. The people can be equally difficult to get to know, though once a bond of trust is formed, many in Winter will honor that bond until death. 

The quickest way to die in Winter is to disrespect the cold. Even the frozen peaks of [[Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Nordthorn/Nordthorn\|Nordthorn]] cannot compare to the wind and snow of Winter. But there is a unique beauty here as well - lights of the Auroras illuminate the sky, bringing celestial spirits down to the surface. 

Winter is made up of dwarves, elves (especially Winter Eladrin, Moon Elves and Shadar Kai), genasi of all kinds, goblinkind, goliath, harengon, kenku, leonid, tabaxi, and shifters of every kind.

> [!recite] While in the Feywild: 

- Do not expect [[Languages/Common\|Common]] to be spoken - many Fey will scorn those who travel to their fair realm expecting to be catered to as on the material plane. (See the back of this booklet for [[Grimkin's Guide to the Winter Court#^14fd2b\|10 useful Sylvan phrases]]!)
- Use caution when making deals. Not every fey is looking to make off with your firstborn - but **words have power**. Ignorance will not excuse or exempt you from a promise made. 
- Leave behind your concept of living beings vs objects. In the fey courts, brooks, boulders, branches and brambles _may_ have sapience. Take no living wood in a forest without leaving a gift, be respectful when drawing water from a spring or well. In other words, err on the side of respect. It is not often that a mountain will wake due to disrespectful footsteps, but it is not unheard of.

> [!Recite|] Helpful Tips from Experienced Travelers: 

- When entering and exiting the [[Krumholtz Mountains\|Krumholtz Mountains]], come prepared with a gift or performance. The clan of sprites who live in these icy cliffs are extremely private, and will deny access to those who do not bring someone to offer for their passage. Those who try to cheat them can be lost for hundreds of years, or find themselves a permanent exhibit in the fairy queen's tower. 
- Winter's strength is drawn from its close ties to the elemental planes, and the courtiers will defend the balance with their lives. Events that disrupt the careful harmony will not be tolerated. No matter their private allegiances, all able Winterlings will stand together against whatever threatens their Court and Realm. 
- Unlike the other Seasonal Courts, Winter has a...looser relationship with death and spirits. It is not unusual to meet a reborn or halfdead - these are intelligent beings that exist in a sort of different timeline. Additionally, there are multiple festivals and holy days dedicated to greeting spirits of those who have passed on long ago. Mausoleums and tombs are frequently visited, rather than tucked away and forgotten. If you come to the Winter to try to plunder treasure from cairns and crypts, you will be unpleasantly surprised.

**[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Ithiliyan\|Ithiliyan]]** personifies compassion and hospitality, embodying the most generous side of the elemental forces that define the transition between the bitter cold and the hopeful dawn. They dwell in the Ghastalphan Mountains, a natural and magical border between the Winter and Spring courts.

**[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Umibuki\|Umibuki]]** is the Rootmother, a serene Archfey who keeps on good terms with **[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]**, keeping the deep cold from freezing the forests of Winter. To her, all in the Underfey give thanks, as her mighty roots hold up the grey sky (the roofs of vast subterranean caverns where most of Winter's population resides. 

**[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Shirosa\|Shirosa]]** is the Roaring Wind, is an Archfey of enormous power who dwells in the thickest blizzards and harshest winds. It is wise to beg her favor before travelling across open ground. There are days her fury runs so deep that only **[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Ithiliyan\|Ithiliyan]]** can calm her. 

**[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]** and **[[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]** are twin dragons who are Archfey of the first snow ([[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]]) and the first melt ([[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]]) of Winter - both the Seasonal Court and the seasonal passage of time. 
- On the last day of autumn, when the Masking Days begin, [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Yatu\|Yatu]] travels away from Winter, bringing the first snowflakes of the year. Where snow cannot fall, he sends other signs of winter's arrival. 
- [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Archfey/Inta\|Inta]] arrives as a sign that the deep cold has passed - that the bitterest temperatures are behind us, and that spring is not far off. Her arrival begins the first melt, as glacial streams and [[Locations/Feywild/Winter/Mosskarm\|Mosskarm]]'s fiery maw send columns of steam up into the air, all the way to [[Locations/Feywild/Solanovis/Solanovis\|Solanovis]].

These five Archfey are intrinsically linked to the land and the weave that flows the Winter. In front of [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Frost\|Frost]] and [[Entities/NPCs/Titans/Winter Court/Monarchs/Thaw\|Thaw]] they may quarrel amongst themselves at times, but all serve their twin rulers with complete adoration and unwavering loyalty.
